In a continent with a large youth population, a common theme across these countries is a desire for citizens to have their voices heard, and a busy election year offers an opportunity for the continent to redeem its democratic credentials and demonstrate its leaning towards strengthening free and fair elections and a more responsive and democratic governance. Given the central role that governance plays in security in Africa, the stakes from many of these elections are high, not only to achieve a democratically elected government but also to achieve stability and development. Since governance norms, insecurity, and economic buoyancy are rarely contained by borders, the conduct and outcomes from each of these elections will also have implications for neighbouring countries and the continent overall. This article considers how the results of recent elections across Africa have been challenged in courts based on mistrust in the use of technology platforms, how the deployment of emerging technology, including AI, is casting a shadow on the integrity of elections in Africa, and the policy options to address these emerging trends with a particular focus on governance of AI technologies through a human rights-based approach and equitable public procurement practices. Policy Significance Statement The increasing mistrust in technology platforms and emerging technologies, such artificial intelligence, highlights a critical challenge for policymakers. With technology increasingly used in electoral processes, there is a need for policies that ensure transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of digital platforms to prevent misinformation, manipulation, and mistrust. Recommendations are proposed on how policymakers should work to establish guidelines or frameworks to regulate technology in elections to protect democratic integrity.",Reinstating trust in elections in the era of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies,access to information; Africa; artificial intelligence; democracy; elections,UNIVERSITY OF WITWATERSRAND,UNIV WITWATERSRAND,NA,"ADELEKE F, 2025, DATA POLICY","ADELEKE F, 2025, DATA POLICY"

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF SCP SYMBOL CONTENT ON ENGAGEMENT, EMOTIONAL RESPONSES, AND TRUST IN ELECTORAL PROCESS IN TIKTOK-BASED ANTI-DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS DURING TAIWANESE 2024 GENERAL ELECTIONS. UTILIZING ADVANCED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING, WE ANALYZED POSTS AND COMMENTS, CATEGORIZING THEM FOR PRESENCE AND TYPE OF SCP SYMBOLS. WE EMPLOYED A MULTI-FACETED APPROACH, EXAMINING ENGAGEMENT METRICS, EMOTIONAL RESPONSES, AND TRUST EVALUATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT SYMBOL CATEGORIES. OUR NOVEL CATEGORIZATION RANGED FROM CONTENT WITHOUT SYMBOLS TO THOSE INCORPORATING MULTIPLE SYMBOL TYPES, PROVIDING NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF SYMBOLIC INFLUENCE. FINDINGS REVEAL A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE COMPLEXITY OF SYMBOLIC CONTENT AND USER ENGAGEMENT, WITH CULTURAL SYMBOLS EMERGING AS POTENT IN DRIVING INTERACTION AND FOSTERING TRUST. EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS SHOWED SYMBOL-RICH CONTENT ELICITED MORE POSITIVE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES, ESPECIALLY WITH CULTURAL SYMBOLS. TRUST EVALUATIONS SHOWED INCREASES IN SYMBOL DIVERSITY INCREASED TRUST, WITH CULTURAL AND POLITICAL SYMBOLS GENERATING THE HIGHEST TRUST LEVELS TOWARDS TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIC AND ELECTORAL PROCESS.

This study investigates the impact of SCP symbol content on engagement, emotional responses, and trust in electoral process in TikTok-based anti-disinformation campaigns during Taiwanese 2024 general elections. Utilizing advanced natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed posts and comments, categorizing them for presence and type of SCP symbols. We employed a multi-faceted approach, examining engagement metrics, emotional responses, and trust evaluations across different symbol categories. Our novel categorization ranged from content without symbols to those incorporating multiple symbol types, providing nuanced understanding of symbolic influence. Findings reveal a strong positive correlation between the complexity of symbolic content and user engagement, with cultural symbols emerging as potent in driving interaction and fostering trust. Emotional analysis showed symbol-rich content elicited more positive emotional responses, especially with cultural symbols. Trust evaluations showed increases in symbol diversity increased trust, with cultural and political symbols generating the highest trust levels towards Taiwan's democratic and electoral process. Statistical validation through non-parametric tests confirmed that the observed effects were not artifacts of data distribution or follower count variations. Our findings have significant implications for public affairs, strategic communications, policymakers, and platform managers, providing a framework for crafting more effective, culturally resonant content in digital socio-political campaigns. This study also opens avenues for further research into the long-term effects of symbolic communication on political behavior and democratic participation in the digital age.",Analyzing the impact of symbols in Taiwan's election-related anti-disinformation campaign on TikTok,Semiotics; TikTok; Emotional analysis; LLM; Generative AI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS LITTLE ROCK;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,UNIV ARKANSAS LITTLE ROCK,NA,"BHATTACHARYA S, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN","BHATTACHARYA S, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN"

THESE ALGORITHMS ARE USED BY ONLINE SERVICES AND PLATFORMS TO DECIDE WHAT CONTENT TO SHOW AND IN WHAT ORDER, AND THEY CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT, INCLUDING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, SOCIAL POLARIZATION, AND ECHO CHAMBERS AROUND IMPORTANT TOPICS. FRANCES HAUGEN, A FORMER FACEBOOK EMPLOYEE TURNED WHISTLEBLOWER, HAS DRAWN SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE BY REVEALING THE COMPANY'S ALLEGED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THEIR OWN ALGORITHMS. ADDITIONALLY, A RECENT INITIATIVE TO BAN TIKTOK AS A THREAT TO US NATIONAL SECURITY INDICATES THE INFLUENCE OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS THREEFOLD. THE FIRST GOAL IS TO PROVIDE AN EXHAUSTIVE EVALUATION OF THE PROFOUND WORLDWIDE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY ALGORITHM-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF PRIORITY ACCORDED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO PIVOTAL SUBJECTS IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS DISCUSSIONS, SUCH AS MISINFORMATION, POLARIZATION, ADDICTION, EMOTIONAL CONTAGION, PRIVACY, AND BIAS. FINALLY, THE THIRD GOAL IS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DISCOURSE IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THESE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS HAVE GLOBALLY. THE RESEARCH CONCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS ON SOCIETY HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION INTERACTS WITH THEM ON A DAILY BASIS. THIS BECOMES ESPECIALLY APPARENT WHEN CONSIDERING THAT ALGORITHMS EXERT INFLUENCE NOT JUST ON MAJOR SOCIETAL ISSUES BUT ON EVERY ASPECT OF A USER'S ONLINE EXPERIENCE. THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMANITY ARE DISCUSSED, SUCH AS ADDICTION TO TECHNOLOGY, WEAKENING RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMANS, AND THE HOMOGENIZING EFFECTS ON HUMAN MINDS. ONE POSSIBLE DIRECTION TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THESE ALGORITHMS IS THE APPLICATION OF ALGORITHMIC REGULATION TO PROMOTE CONTENT DIVERSITY AND FACILITATE DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT, SUCH AS THE TRIPARTITE SOLUTION WHICH IS ELABORATED UPON IN THE CONCLUSION.

These algorithms are used by online services and platforms to decide what content to show and in what order, and they can have a negative impact, including the spread of misinformation, social polarization, and echo chambers around important topics. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, has drawn significant public attention to this issue by revealing the company's alleged knowledge about the negative impacts of their own algorithms. Additionally, a recent initiative to ban TikTok as a threat to US national security indicates the influence of recommender systems. The objective of this study is threefold. The first goal is to provide an exhaustive evaluation of the profound worldwide influence exerted by algorithm-based recommendations. The second goal is to determine the degree of priority accorded by the scientific community to pivotal subjects in recommender systems discussions, such as misinformation, polarization, addiction, emotional contagion, privacy, and bias. Finally, the third goal is to assess whether the level of scientific research and discourse is commensurate with the significant impact these recommendation systems have globally. The research concludes the impact of recommender systems on society has been largely neglected by the scientific community, despite the fact that more than half of the world's population interacts with them on a daily basis. This becomes especially apparent when considering that algorithms exert influence not just on major societal issues but on every aspect of a user's online experience. The potential consequences for humanity are discussed, such as addiction to technology, weakening relations between humans, and the homogenizing effects on human minds. One possible direction to address the challenges posed by these algorithms is the application of algorithmic regulation to promote content diversity and facilitate democratic engagement, such as the tripartite solution which is elaborated upon in the conclusion. Therefore, future research should not only be centered around further evaluating influence of this technology, but also the analysis of how such systems can be regulated. A broader conversation among all stakeholders should be evoked on these potential approaches, aiming to align AI with societal values and enhance human wellbeing.",AI alignment: Assessing the global impact of recommender systems,AI alignment; Digital humanism; Recommender systems; Global impact; Social polarization,UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE,L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"BOJIC L, 2024, FUTURES","BOJIC L, 2024, FUTURES"

THE EASE WITH WHICH GENERATIVE AI CAN PRODUCE NARRATIVES ON SENSITIVE TOPICS RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL HARMS, SUCH AS AMPLIFYING BIASES OR SPREADING MISINFORMATION. OUR STUDY JUXTAPOSES THE CONTENT GENERATED BY A STATE-OF-THE-ART GENERATIVE AI, SPECIFICALLY CHATGPT-4, WITH ACTUAL ARTICLES FROM LEADING UK MEDIA OUTLETS ON THE TOPIC OF IMMIGRATION. OUR SPECIFIC CASE STUDY FOCUSSES ON THE REPRESENTATION OF EASTERN EUROPEAN ROMA MIGRANTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 2016 UK REFERENDUM ON EU MEMBERSHIP. THROUGH A COMPARATIVE CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS, WE UNCOVER PATTERNS OF REPRESENTATION, INHERENT BIASES AND POTENTIAL DISCREPANCIES IN REPRESENTATION BETWEEN AI-GENERATED NARRATIVES AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA DISCOURSE WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CHATGPT-4 EXHIBITS A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF OBJECTIVITY IN ITS REPORTING AND DEMONSTRATES HEIGHTENED RACIAL AWARENESS IN THE CONTENT IT PRODUCES. MOREOVER, IT APPEARS TO CONSISTENTLY PRIORITISE FACTUAL ACCURACY OVER SENSATIONALISM. ALL THESE FEATURES SET IT APART FROM RIGHT-WING MEDIA ARTICLES IN OUR SAMPLE. THIS IS FURTHER EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT, IN MOST INSTANCES, CHATGPT-4 REFRAINS FROM GENERATING TEXT OR DOES SO ONLY AFTER CONSIDERABLE ADJUSTMENTS WHEN PROMPTED WITH HEADLINES THAT THE MODEL DEEMS INFLAMMATORY.

Through a comparative critical discourse analysis, we uncover patterns of representation, inherent biases and potential discrepancies in representation between AI-generated narratives and mainstream media discourse with different political views. Preliminary findings suggest that ChatGPT-4 exhibits a remarkable degree of objectivity in its reporting and demonstrates heightened racial awareness in the content it produces. Moreover, it appears to consistently prioritise factual accuracy over sensationalism. All these features set it apart from right-wing media articles in our sample. This is further evidenced by the fact that, in most instances, ChatGPT-4 refrains from generating text or does so only after considerable adjustments when prompted with headlines that the model deems inflammatory. While these features can be attributed to the model's diverse training data and model architecture, the findings invite further examination to determine the full scope of ChatGPT-4's capabilities and its potential shortcomings in representing the full spectrum of social and political perspectives prevalent in society.",ChatGPT-4 as a journalist: Whose perspectives is it reproducing?,AI and Journalism; AI biases; Artificial sociality; ChatGPT-4; critical discourse analysis; generative AI; hate speech; Large Language Models (LLMs),UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,UNIV CAMBRIDGE,NA,"BREAZU P, 2024, DISCOURSE SOC","BREAZU P, 2024, DISCOURSE SOC"

As the federal government consults on AI regulation, this article aims to move policymakers' focus beyond the deepfake 'problem' to investigate the implications of generative AI screen technologies from two creative industries perspectives. First, it establishes the negative and positive uses of deepfake applications in media, politics, commerce, education, film and art. Second, it compares the forms and scope of emerging international deepfake regulations with those proposed in Australia to conceptualise the impact that restrictions on deepfakes might have for domestic screen producers, flagging the potential closure of artistic and public expression. In doing so, we highlight that a STEM-focused approach to deepfake regulation is insufficiently attuned to the benefits of synthetic media applications in the post-truth AI communications economy.","Beyond the deepfake problem: Benefits, risks and regulation of generative AI screen technologies",deepfake video; generative adversarial networks (GANs); regulation; screen industry; AI policy; synthetic media; disinformation; VFX,UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY,UNIV SYDNEY,NA,"BROINOWSKI A, 2024, MEDIA INT AUST","BROINOWSKI A, 2024, MEDIA INT AUST"

WE TEST THESE PREDICTIONS BY EXAMINING THE ROLES OF MENTAL REPRESENTATION AND EPISTEMIC QUALITY IN DECISIONS TO SHARE MISINFORMATIVE ARTICLES ON FACEBOOK ACROSS TWO EXPERIMENTS AND TWO CORRELATIONAL STUDIES. IN STUDIES 1 AND 2, WE USE FACEBOOK DATA TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GIST PROXIES IN TEXT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ONLINE SHARING. IN STUDY 3, WE EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATE SUBJECTS' EXPOSURE TO A GIST-BASED INTERVENTION THAT EXPLAINS WHY A MISINFORMATIVE ARTICLE IS FALSE, A SIMPLE DEBUNK STATING ONLY THAT THE ARTICLE IS FALSE (BUT NOT EXPLAINING WHY) AND A VERBATIM CONDITION PROVIDING RELEVANT DETAILED INFORMATION BUT ALLOWING SUBJECTS TO DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS. WE FOUND THAT THE GIST CONDITION DECREASED INTENTIONS TO SHARE MISINFORMATION. FINALLY, IN STUDY 4, WE REPLICATED THIS FINDING AND SHOWED THAT THE GIST CONDITION ALSO REDUCES MISINFORMATION ENDORSEMENT.

Most people value the truth. Thus, per FTT, people decide to share messages that they perceive as true. FTT also predicts that messages will be more effective if they communicate a simple gist. We test these predictions by examining the roles of mental representation and epistemic quality in decisions to share misinformative articles on Facebook across two experiments and two correlational studies. In Studies 1 and 2, we use Facebook data to test the hypothesis that gist proxies in text are associated with online sharing. In Study 3, we experimentally manipulate subjects' exposure to a gist-based intervention that explains why a misinformative article is false, a simple debunk stating only that the article is false (but not explaining why) and a verbatim condition providing relevant detailed information but allowing subjects to draw their own conclusions. We found that the gist condition decreased intentions to share misinformation. Finally, in Study 4, we replicated this finding and showed that the gist condition also reduces misinformation endorsement. Results provide support for FTT's predictions regarding reducing sharing and endorsement of misinformation on social media.",The Role of Mental Representation in Sharing Misinformation Online,fuzzy-trace theory; epistemic valence; gist; misinformation; online sharing,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF OHIO;OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIV,NA,"BRONIATOWSKI DA, 2024, J EXP PSYCHOL-APPL","BRONIATOWSKI DA, 2024, J EXP PSYCHOL-APPL"

INCIDENTS WITH AI ARE STUDIED IN RELATION TO FIVE SECTORS (POLICE, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION AND ACADEMIA, POLITICS, AUTOMOTIVE) USING THE AIAAIC REPOSITORY. A TOTAL OF 125 INCIDENTS ARE SAMPLED AND ANALYZED BY CONDUCTING A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS ON MEDIA REPORTS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CERTAIN ETHICAL PRINCIPLES ARE FOUND BREACHED ACROSS SECTORS: ACCURACY/RELIABILITY, BIAS/DISCRIMINATION, TRANSPARENCY, SURVEILLANCE/PRIVACY, SECURITY. HOWEVER, RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT 1) SOME ETHICAL ISSUES (MISINFORMATION, SAFETY, PREMISE/INTENT) ARE SECTOR SPECIFIC, 2) THE CONSEQUENCES AND MEANING OF THE SAME ETHICAL ISSUE IS ABLE TO VARY ACROSS SECTORS AND 3) PRE-EXISTING SECTOR-SPECIFIC ISSUES ARE REPRODUCED WITH THESE ETHICAL BREACHES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES ARE RELEVANT TO DISCUSS ACROSS SECTORS, YET, A SECTOR-BASED APPROACH TO AI ETHICS GIVES IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON SECTOR-SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL ISSUES.","BUREMA, DAFNA;DEBOWSKI-WEIMANN, NICOLE;VON JANOWSKI, ALEXANDER;GRABOWSKI, JIL;MAFTEI, MIHAI;JACOBS, MATTIS;VAN DER SMAGT, PATRICK;BENBOUZID, DJALEL","AIAAIC, ABOUT THE AIAAIC REPOSITORY;ALGO.RULES, 2019, REGELN FUR DIE GESTALTUNG ALGORITHMISCHER SYSTEME;ANANNY M, 2016, SCI TECHNOL HUM VAL, V41, P93, DOI 10.1177/0162243915606523;ANDREJEVIC M, 2014, SURVEILL SOC, V12, P185;ANONYMOUS, 2017, WASH.

Incidents with AI are studied in relation to five sectors (police, healthcare, education and academia, politics, automotive) using the AIAAIC repository. A total of 125 incidents are sampled and analyzed by conducting a qualitative content analysis on media reports. The results show that certain ethical principles are found breached across sectors: accuracy/reliability, bias/discrimination, transparency, surveillance/privacy, security. However, results also show that 1) some ethical issues (misinformation, safety, premise/intent) are sector specific, 2) the consequences and meaning of the same ethical issue is able to vary across sectors and 3) pre-existing sector-specific issues are reproduced with these ethical breaches. The paper concludes that general ethical principles are relevant to discuss across sectors, yet, a sector-based approach to AI ethics gives in-depth information on sector-specific structural issues.",A sector-based approach to AI ethics: Understanding ethical issues of AI-related incidents within their sectoral context,Artificial Intelligence; AI deployment; AI Ethics; AI incidents; Sectors; Media Reports,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN;VOLKSWAGEN;VOLKSWAGEN GERMANY;VOLKSWAGEN;VOLKSWAGEN GERMANY;VOLKSWAGEN;VOLKSWAGEN GERMANY;EOTVOS LORAND UNIVERSITY,TECH UNIV BERLIN;SCI INTELLIGENCE,NA,"BUREMA D, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 AAAI/ACM CONFERENCE ON AI, ETHICS, AND SOCIETY, AIES 2023","BUREMA D, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 AAAI/ACM CONFERENCE ON AI, ETHICS, AND SOCIETY, AIES 2023"

THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES DECENTRALIZED WEB3 MECHANISMS-BLOCKCHAIN, DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATIONS (DAOS), AND DATA COOPERATIVES-AS FOUNDATIONAL TOOLS FOR ENHANCING TRUST IN GENAI. THESE MECHANISMS ARE ANALYZED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU'S AI ACT AND THE DRAGHI REPORT, FOCUSING ON THEIR POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT CONTENT AUTHENTICITY, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN VERIFICATION, AND DATA SOVEREIGNTY. BASED ON A SYSTEMATIC POLICY ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A MULTI-LAYERED FRAMEWORK TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF AI-GENERATED MISINFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY, AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS, IT IDENTIFIES AND EVALUATES SEVEN DETECTION TECHNIQUES OF TRUST STEMMING FROM THE ACTION RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THE HORIZON EUROPE LIGHTHOUSE PROJECT CALLED ENFIELD: (I) FEDERATED LEARNING FOR DECENTRALIZED AI DETECTION, (II) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PROVENANCE TRACKING, (III) ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS FOR CONTENT AUTHENTICATION, (IV) DAOS FOR CROWDSOURCED VERIFICATION, (V) AI-POWERED DIGITAL WATERMARKING, (VI) EXPLAINABLE AI (XAI) FOR CONTENT DETECTION, AND (VII) PRIVACY-PRESERVING MACHINE LEARNING (PPML). BY LEVERAGING THESE APPROACHES, THE FRAMEWORK STRENGTHENS AI GOVERNANCE THROUGH PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) STRUCTURES WHILE ADDRESSING THE SOCIO-POLITICAL CHALLENGES OF AI-DRIVEN MISINFORMATION.

ARE WE GOING TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT ALL THE FACTS OR SHARING ALL THE FACTS WITH THE PUBLIC. - AT A BARE MINIMUM THE TAX PAYERS ARE IN FOR MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN. NOT INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO DO. - THE FIELD OF DREAMS HAS TO BE WORTH MUCH MORE THAN AURORA IS PAYING FOR IT. - AURORA WOULD GET THEIR NICE NEW FACILITY IF THEY BUILT ON COMMERCIAL LAND, ""PROGRESS"" WOULD STILL HAPPEN BUT NOT AT THE TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE. THE SUPPOSED NEW JOBS, WILL HAPPEN WHEREVER THEY BUILD. - WE WOULD STILL GAIN NO NEW TAXES NO MATTER WHERE AURORA BUILDS. - THE KIDS DON'T GIVE A DARN ABOUT TOURNAMENT GRADE FIELDS, THEY PLAY IN OUR BACKYARDS, IN OUR BUMPY PARKS, IN OUR STREETS (CAREFUL OF THE POTHOLES). ACCORDING TO THE RETTLER CORPORATION, LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE FIRM, WHO DID A PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATE OVER 3 YEARS AGO FOR THE CITY/SASD...THE TAXPAYERS WILL BE IN FOR A MINIMUM OF MILLION DOLLARS EVEN WITH AURORA'S ""DONATION"" TO REPLACE THE SOCCER FIELDS. (ATTACHED) IN ORDER FOR THIS DEAL TO HAPPEN TAX PAYERS WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP THIS MONEY BECAUSE THE FIELD OF DREAMS MUST BE REPLACED. THERE IS A COVENANT ON THE FIELD OF DREAMS TO BE KEPT AS A PARK FOR PERPETUITY BASED ON THE GRANT WE RECEIVED FROM THE DNR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL PARKS (ATTACHED). ANOTHER MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT AURORA IS ONLY PAYING .5 MILLION FOR THE LAND. THE MENARDS PROPERTY SOLD FOR MILLION DOLLARS IN 2014 FOR 20.5 ACRES. THE BUILDINGS ON THE PROPERTY THEN HAD TO BE DEMOLISHED AND CLEANED UP FOR IT TO BE BUILT ON. THE FIELD OF DREAMS IS 35 ACRES, AT GREEN STATE, AND SUPPOSEDLY THE LAST PIECE OF VIABLE PROPERTY IN ALL OF SHEBOYGAN TO BUILD ON, AND IT'S ONLY WORTH .5 MILLION???

This article examines decentralized Web3 mechanisms-blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and data cooperatives-as foundational tools for enhancing trust in GenAI. These mechanisms are analyzed within the framework of the EU's AI Act and the Draghi Report, focusing on their potential to support content authenticity, community-driven verification, and data sovereignty. Based on a systematic policy analysis, this article proposes a multi-layered framework to mitigate the risks of AI-generated misinformation. Specifically, as a result of this analysis, it identifies and evaluates seven detection techniques of trust stemming from the action research conducted in the Horizon Europe Lighthouse project called ENFIELD: (i) federated learning for decentralized AI detection, (ii) blockchain-based provenance tracking, (iii) zero-knowledge proofs for content authentication, (iv) DAOs for crowdsourced verification, (v) AI-powered digital watermarking, (vi) explainable AI (XAI) for content detection, and (vii) privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). By leveraging these approaches, the framework strengthens AI governance through peer-to-peer (P2P) structures while addressing the socio-political challenges of AI-driven misinformation. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of resilient democratic systems in an era of increasing technopolitical polarization.",Trustworthy AI for Whom?

Disinformation can manipulate democracy, public opinion, disrupt markets, and cause panic or even fatalities. Thus, swift detection and possible prevention of disinformation are vital, especially with the daily flood of 3.2 billion images and 720,000 hours of videos on social media platforms, necessitating efficient fact verification. Despite progress in automatic text-based fact verification (e.g., FEVER, LIAR), the research community lacks substantial effort in multimodal fact verification. To address this gap, we introduce FACTIFY 3M, a dataset of 3 million samples that pushes the boundaries of the domain of fact verification via a multimodal fake news dataset, in addition to offering explainability through the concept of 5W question-answering. Salient features of the dataset are: (i) textual claims, (ii) GPT3.5-generated paraphrased claims, (iii) associated images, (iv) stable diffusion-generated additional images (i.e., visual paraphrases), (v) pixel-level image heatmap to foster image-text explainability of the claim, (vi) 5W QA pairs, and (vii) adversarial fake news stories.",A benchmark for multimodal fact verification with explainability through 5W Question-Answering,NA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA COLUMBIA;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES;STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UNIV SOUTH CAROLINA,NA,"CHAKRABORTY M, 2023, 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)","CHAKRABORTY M, 2023, 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)"

THESE BOOKS SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TO MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT IN SOCIAL MEDIA HAS CREATED A FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER THAT IS EXPLOITING HUMAN WEAKNESSES WITH PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, THE ILLUSORY TRUTH EFFECT, PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING, AND SKINNER'S INTERMITTENT VARIABLE REINFORCEMENT. JUST AS WE CANNOT EXPECT TOBACCO COMPANIES TO SELL FEWER CIGARETTES AND PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH AHEAD OF PROFITS, SO TOO, IT MAY BE ASKING TOO MUCH OF COMPANIES (AND COUNTRIES) TO STOP TRAFFICKING IN MISINFORMATION GIVEN THAT IT IS SO EFFECTIVE AND SO INSANELY PROFITABLE (AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM). EVENTUALLY, WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT CHAOS WILL END, LIKE THE LAWLESSNESS IN WILD WEST, BECAUSE CHAOS IS BAD FOR BUSINESS. AS COMPUTER SCIENTISTS, THIS PAPER WILL SUMMARIZE CRITICISMS FROM OTHER FIELDS AND FOCUS ON IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE; WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE OTHER FIELDS.

Much of this work focuses on fairness and biases (henceforth Risks 1.0), following the 2016 best seller: Weapons of Math Destruction. Two books published in 2022, The Chaos Machine and Like, Comment, Subscribe, raise additional risks to public health/safety/security such as genocide, insurrection, polarized politics, vaccinations (henceforth, Risks 2.0). These books suggest that the use of machine learning to maximize engagement in social media has created a Frankenstein Monster that is exploiting human weaknesses with persuasive technology, the illusory truth effect, Pavlovian conditioning, and Skinner's intermittent variable reinforcement. Just as we cannot expect tobacco companies to sell fewer cigarettes and prioritize public health ahead of profits, so too, it may be asking too much of companies (and countries) to stop trafficking in misinformation given that it is so effective and so insanely profitable (at least in the short term). Eventually, we believe the current chaos will end, like the lawlessness in Wild West, because chaos is bad for business. As computer scientists, this paper will summarize criticisms from other fields and focus on implications for computer science; we will not attempt to contribute to those other fields. There is quite a bit of work in computer science on these risks, especially on Risks 1.0 (bias and fairness), but more work is needed, especially on Risks 2.0 (addictive, dangerous, and deadly).","Emerging trends: Unfair, biased, addictive, dangerous, deadly, and insanely profitable",Bias; Responsible AI; Addictive; Social media; Engagement; Risk; Human weaknesses; Misinformation; Truth effects,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY;HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN,NORTHEASTERN UNIV,NA,"CHURCH K, 2023, NAT LANG ENG","CHURCH K, 2023, NAT LANG ENG"

Against a backdrop of inexorable progress in generative AI for computer graphics, over two billion people will vote in public elections this year. Emerging standards and provenance enhancing tools promise to play an important role in fighting fake news and the spread of misinformation. In this article, we contrast three provenance enhancing technologies-metadata, fingerprinting, and watermarking-and discuss how we can build upon the complementary strengths of these three pillars to provide robust trust signals to support stories told by real and generative images. Beyond authenticity, we describe how provenance can also underpin new models for value creation in the age of generative AI. In doing so, we address other risks arising with generative AI such as ensuring training consent, and the proper attribution of credit to creatives who contribute their work to train generative models. We show that provenance may be combined with distributed ledger technology to develop novel solutions for recognizing and rewarding creative endeavor in the age of generative AI.","To Authenticity, and Beyond!

This research aims to understand and analyze the perceptions generated by the irruption of ChatGPT among fact-checking professionals in Spain with the aim of identifying disadvantages and advantages in its use, professional implications and desired functionalities. The study uses qualitative methodology with in-depth interviews with professionals from all Spanish fact-checking platforms belonging to the International Factchecking Network (IFCN) and the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO). The results conclude that the use of ChatGPT presents notable ambivalences. On the one hand, there are perceived drawbacks in issues such as the transparency and reliability of sources, the scope of the data, and the format of the responses generated. However, fact-checkers also point to a possible auxiliary use of the chatbot in the tasks of gathering information, detecting falsehoods, and producing denials. The irruption of ChatGPT has a direct impact on the work routines of the fact-checkers, which can be made more difficult, reinforced or extended. Fact-checking professionals perceive themselves as ""context agents"" in a new ecosystem that also obliges them to further diversify their fields of action in the fight against disinformation and to accelerate the implementation of media education actions that empower citizens in the responsible use of artificial intelligence.",Retraining fact-checkers: The emergence of ChatGPT in information verification,Fact-checking; Fact-checking platforms; Digital verification; Journalism; Computational fact-checking; Fact-checkers; Di-sinformation; Misinformation; Artificial Intelligence; AI; Generative artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Chatbots,POMPEU FABRA UNIVERSITY,UNIV POMPEU FABRA,NA,"CUARTIELLES R, 2023, PROF INFORM","CUARTIELLES R, 2023, PROF INFORM"

IN RECENT YEARS AI-POWERED TECHNIQUES SUCH AS PROFILING, TARGETING, ELECTION MANIPULATION, AND MASSIVE DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS VIA SOCIAL BOTS AND TROLL FARMS CHALLENGE THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, DEMANDS FOR REGULATING AI HAVE GOTTEN LOUDER. IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AS THE ACTOR THAT HAS GONE THE FURTHEST IN TERMS OF REGULATING AI. WE THEREFORE ASK: WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENTS DOES THE EU ENVISION IN THEIR BINDING AND NON-BINDING DOCUMENTS TO PREVENT AI HARM TO DEMOCRACY? AND WHAT CRITIQUE CAN BE FORMULATED REGARDING THESE INSTRUMENTS? TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, THE ARTICLE MAKES TWO CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, BY BUILDING ON A SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY, WE INTRODUCE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO TYPES OF HARM THAT CAN ARISE FROM THE WIDESPREAD USE OF AI: RIGHTS-BASED HARM AND SYSTEMIC HARM. SECOND, BY ANALYSING A NUMBER OF EU DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE GDPR, THE AI ACT, THE TTAP, AND THE DSA, WE ARGUE THAT THE EU ENVISIONS FOUR PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS FOR SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY FROM THE HARMFUL USE OF AI: PROHIBITION, TRANSPARENCY, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND DIGITAL EDUCATION.

In recent years AI-powered techniques such as profiling, targeting, election manipulation, and massive disinformation campaigns via social bots and troll farms challenge the very foundations of democratic systems. Against this background, demands for regulating AI have gotten louder. In this paper, we focus on the European Union (EU) as the actor that has gone the furthest in terms of regulating AI. We therefore ask: What kind of instruments does the EU envision in their binding and non-binding documents to prevent AI harm to democracy? And what critique can be formulated regarding these instruments? To address these questions, the article makes two contributions. First, by building on a systematic understanding of deliberative democracy, we introduce the distinction between two types of harm that can arise from the widespread use of AI: rights-based harm and systemic harm. Second, by analysing a number of EU documents, including the GDPR, the AI Act, the TTAP, and the DSA, we argue that the EU envisions four primary instruments for safeguarding democracy from the harmful use of AI: prohibition, transparency, risk management, and digital education. While these instruments provide a relatively high level of protection for rights-based AI harm, there is still ample space for these technologies to produce systemic harm to democracy.",Regulate against the machine: how the EU mitigates AI harm to democracy,Artificial Intelligence (AI); democracy; harm; European Union (EU); AI Act,EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY VIADRINA FRANKFURT ODER,WZB BERLIN SOCIAL SCI CTR,NA,"CUPAC J, 2024, DEMOCRATIZATION","CUPAC J, 2024, DEMOCRATIZATION"

Unlike earlier forms of disinformation relying on text or traditional video-editing techniques (cheapfakes), deepfakes employ artificial intelligence, provoking speculations that they may be even more persuasive and harder to debunk. Using an experiment with a multiple-message design (N = 2,085), we found that fake videos suggesting a sex, corruption, or prejudice scandal-but not text-only fakes-elicited substantial reputational damage for an innocent politician, regardless of whether the underlying technique was ""cheap"" or ""deep."" This was visible in altered attitudes, emotions, and voting intentions. However, exposure to a journalistic fact-check substantially reduced and even eliminated the detrimental effects. These findings have important implications for our theoretical understanding related to the effects of and mitigation strategies for deepfakes.

TO ADDRESS THIS, A GROWING CADRE OF PROFESSIONAL FACT-CHECKERS AND JOURNALISTS PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS INTO PURPORTED FACTS. HOWEVER, THESE LARGELY MANUAL EFFORTS HAVE STRUGGLED TO MATCH THE ENORMOUS SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. IN RESPONSE, A GROWING BODY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR MORE SCALABLE FACT-CHECKING. DESPITE TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN SUCH RESEARCH, HOWEVER, PRACTICAL ADOPTION OF NLP TECHNOLOGIES FOR FACT-CHECKING STILL REMAINS IN ITS INFANCY TODAY. IN THIS WORK, WE REVIEW THE CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT NLP TECHNOLOGIES FOR FACT-CHECKING. OUR PARTICULAR FOCUS IS TO FURTHER CHART THE DESIGN SPACE FOR HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE HARNESSED AND REFINED IN ORDER TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF HUMAN FACT-CHECKERS. TO DO SO, WE REVIEW KEY ASPECTS OF NLP-BASED FACT-CHECKING: TASK FORMULATION, DATASET CONSTRUCTION, MODELING, AND HUMAN-CENTERED STRATEGIES, SUCH AS EXPLAINABLE MODELS AND HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP APPROACHES. NEXT, WE REVIEW THE EFFICACY OF APPLYING NLP-BASED FACT-CHECKING TOOLS TO ASSIST HUMAN FACT-CHECKERS. WE RECOMMEND THAT FUTURE RESEARCH INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH FACT-CHECKER STAKEHOLDERS EARLY ON IN NLP RESEARCH, AS WELL AS INCORPORATION OF HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN PRACTICES IN MODEL DEVELOPMENT, IN ORDER TO FURTHER GUIDE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR HUMAN USE AND PRACTICAL ADOPTION. FINALLY, WE ADVOCATE FOR MORE RESEARCH ON BENCHMARK DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTING EXTRINSIC EVALUATION OF HUMAN-CENTERED FACT-CHECKING TECHNOLOGIES.","DAS, ANUBRATA;LIU, HOUJIANG;KOVATCHEV, VENELIN;LEASE, MATTHEW","ADAIR B., 2020, SQUASH REPORT CARD I;ADAIR B., 2021, GLOB FACT 8 PRER SEG;ADAIR B., 2020, LESSON IN AUTOMATED JOURNALISM: BRING BACK THE HUMANS;AHMADI N, 2020, ACM J DATA INF QUAL, V12, DOI 10.1145/3409384;AHMADI NASER., 2019, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 TRUTH AND TRUST ONLINE CONFERENCE;AHSAN M., 2019, INT.

To address this, a growing cadre of professional fact-checkers and journalists provide high-quality investigations into purported facts. However, these largely manual efforts have struggled to match the enormous scale of the problem. In response, a growing body of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have been proposed for more scalable fact-checking. Despite tremendous growth in such research, however, practical adoption of NLP technologies for fact-checking still remains in its infancy today. In this work, we review the capabilities and limitations of the current NLP technologies for fact-checking. Our particular focus is to further chart the design space for how these technologies can be harnessed and refined in order to better meet the needs of human fact-checkers. To do so, we review key aspects of NLP-based fact-checking: task formulation, dataset construction, modeling, and human-centered strategies, such as explainable models and human-in-the-loop approaches. Next, we review the efficacy of applying NLP-based fact-checking tools to assist human fact-checkers. We recommend that future research include collaboration with fact-checker stakeholders early on in NLP research, as well as incorporation of human-centered design practices in model development, in order to further guide technology development for human use and practical adoption. Finally, we advocate for more research on benchmark development supporting extrinsic evaluation of human-centered fact-checking technologies.",The state of human-centered NLP technology for fact-checking,Natural Language Processing; Misinformation; Disinformation; Explainability; Human-AI teaming,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN,UNIV TEXAS AUSTIN,NA,"DAS A, 2023, INFORM PROCESS MANAG","DAS A, 2023, INFORM PROCESS MANAG"

Now, people can get to know what is going on around the globe with just a click; however, this has also resulted in the issue of fake news. Fake news is content that pretends to be true but is actually false and is disseminated to defraud. Fake news poses a threat to harmony, politics, the economy, and public opinion. As a result, bogus news detection has become an emerging research domain to identify a given piece of text as genuine or fraudulent. In this paper, a new framework called Generative Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (GBERT) is proposed that leverages a combination of Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and addresses the fake news classification problem. This framework combines the best features of both cutting-edge techniques-BERT's deep contextual understanding and the generative capabilities of GPT-to create a comprehensive representation of a given text. Both GPT and BERT are fine-tuned on two real-world benchmark corpora and have attained 95.30 % accuracy, 95.13 % precision, 97.35 % sensitivity, and a 96.23 % F1 score. The statistical test results indicate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned framework for fake news detection and suggest that it can be a promising approach for eradicating this global issue of fake news in the digital landscape.",GBERT: A hybrid deep learning model based on GPT-BERT for fake news detection,Deep learning; Fake news detection; Internet access; Large language model; Social media; Technology; Text classification; Transformers,"CHITKARA UNIVERSITY, PUNJAB;KIET GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS;YEUNGNAM UNIVERSITY;KING SAUD UNIVERSITY",KING SAUD UNIV,NA,"DHIMAN P, 2024, HELIYON","DHIMAN P, 2024, HELIYON"

Between the excitement of the availability of AI systems that no longer require the mastery of programming skills and the exploration of a new field of experimentation, academics and professionals foresaw the benefits of such technology. Critics have raised concerns about the fairness and of the data used to train Large Language Models (LLMs), including the risk of artificial hallucinations and the proliferation of machine-generated content that could spread misinformation. As LLMs pose ethical challenges, how can professional fact-checking mitigate risks? This narrative literature review explores the current state of LLMs in the context of fact-checking practice, highlighting three key complementary mitigation strategies related to education, ethics and professional practice.",Striking the Balance in Using LLMs for Fact-Checking: A Narrative Literature Review,Fact-checking; Large Language Models; Risk mitigation,UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN DENMARK,UNIV BERGEN;UNIV SOUTHERN DENMARK,NA,"DIERICKX L, 2024, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","DIERICKX L, 2024, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC"

THIS PHENOMENON LEADS TO NEW POLITICAL COMMUNICATION TACTICS, BUT ALSO EXPOSES CITIZENS TO POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT, CONTAMINATED OR POLARISED CONTENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, FRAMED IN POST-TRUTH, THE TERM 'FAKE NEWS' GAINS RELEVANCE AS A WAY OF REFERRING TO DISINFORMATION AND AS A POLITICAL AND PERFORMATIVE ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE WEAPONISED. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO ANALYSE SUCH USE IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DURING HIS PRESIDENTIAL TERM (2017-2021), FOCUSSING ON TWITTER AS THE MAIN PLATFORM IN HIS POLITICAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGY ONLINE. TO ANALYSE THIS, WE RESORT TO A METHODOLOGICAL TRIANGULATION OF CONTENT, DISCOURSE, AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WITH THE LATTER COMBINING BOTH LEXICON AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNIQUES THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING ON THE BASIS OF DEEP LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, WHICH IS APPLIED TO HIS MESSAGES PUBLISHED WITH THE TERM 'FAKE NEWS' (N = 768). THE ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLE, PROVIDED HERE IN AN OPEN DATASET, EMPLOYS SELF-DEVELOPED SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS EACH UNIT OF ANALYSIS TO BE FILTERED AND CODED AROUND ITS PREDOMINANT THEMES, SENTIMENTS, AND WORDS. THE MAIN RESULTS CONFIRM THAT TRUMP'S ATTRIBUTION OF 'FAKE NEWS' FOCUSSES ON THREE MAIN TOPICS: THE MEDIA (53%), POLITICS (40%) AND HIS CABINET (33%). IT ALSO SHOWS HOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT RESORTS TO A PERSONALIST AGENDA, FOCUSSED ON THE DEFENCE OF HIS PROPOSALS AND HIS TEAM (80%) BY DELEGITIMIZING HIS OPPONENTS AND THE PRESS, WITH A NEGATIVE TONE (72%) LOADED WITH DEROGATORY TERMS, CONFIRMING A WEAPONISED STRATEGY OF THE TERM 'FAKE NEWS' AS A POLITICAL ARGUMENT OF DISINFORMATION AND DISINTERMEDIATION.","DIEZ-GRACIA, ALBA;SANCHEZ-GARCIA, PILAR;MARTIN-ROMAN, JAVIER;CENTENO-MARTIN, HECTOR;TOLEDANO-BUENDIA, SAMUEL;ARDEVOL-ABREU, ALBERTO;LIVBERBER, TUBA;CUARTIELLES, ROGER;RAMON-VEGAS, XAVIER;PONT-SORRIBES, CARLES;GUTIERREZ-CANEDA, BEATRIZ;VAZQUEZ-HERRERO, JORGE;LOPEZ-GARCIA, XOSE;CARABANTES, DAVID;GONZALEZ-GERALDO, JOSE L.;JOVER, GONZALO;SUAU, JAUME;PUERTAS-GRAELL, DAVID","ALBRIGHT J, 2017, MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON, V5, P87, DOI 10.17645/MAC.V5I2.977;BARBU O., 2014, PROCEDIA - SOCIALAND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, V163, P44, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2014.12.284;BEER D, 2007, SOCIOL RES ONLINE, V12;BERROCAL S, 2014, COMUNICAR, V22, P65, DOI 10.3916/C43-2014-06;BERROCAL-GONZALO S, 2022, INDEX COMUN, V12, P13, DOI 10.33732/IXC/12/01POLITI;BLEAKLEY P, 2018, CAP CL, V42, P419, DOI 10.1177/0309816818759231;BORGESIUS FJZ, 2018, UTRECHT LAW REV, V14, P82, DOI 10.18352/ULR.420;BOSHMAF Y, 2011, 27TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SECURITY APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (ACSAC 2011), P93;BRADSHAW S, 2020, POLIT COMMUN, V37, P173, DOI 10.1080/10584609.2019.1663322;LORENZO FC, 2019, HIST COMUN SOC, V24, P471, DOI 10.5209/HICS.66291;CANO-OR√ìN L, 2021, PROF INFORM, V30, DOI 10.3145/EPI.2021.JUL.12;CANO-OR√ìN L, 2021, MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON, V9, P217, DOI 10.17645/MAC.V9I1.3335;CARLSON M, 2018, NEW MEDIA SOC, V20, P1755, DOI 10.1177/1461444817706684;CARMI E, 2020, INTERNET POLICY REV, V9, DOI 10.14763/2020.2.1481;CASTELLS MANUEL, 2009, COMUNICACION Y PODER;CHANDRA R, 2021, IEEE ACCESS, V9, P128494, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111035;CINELLI M, 2021, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V118, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.2023301118;COLEMAN S, 2005, NEW MEDIA SOC, V7, P177, DOI 10.1177/1461444805050745;COLONESCU CONSTANTIN., 2018, ATHENS JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS, P375;COURTY AUDREY, 2021, THE CONVERSATION13TH JANUARY;DANG NC, 2020, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ, V9, DOI 10.3390/ELECTRONICS9030483;DAS-SARMA MATTHEW, 2016, INQUIRIES, V8;DWIANTO RAHMAD-AGUS, 2021, WEBOLOGY, V18, P389, DOI 10.14704/WEB/V1811/WEB18096, DOI 10.14704/WEB/V1811/WEB18096;ENGUIX-OLIVER SALVADOR, 2020, PASAJES, V59, P19;ERMAKOVA T, 2021, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (WEBIST), P103, DOI 10.5220/0010709400003058;FARKAS JOHAN., 2020, POST-TRUTH, FAKE NEWS, AND DEMOCRACY: MAPPING THE POLITICS OF FALSEHOOD;FERNANDEZ-CASTRILLO C., 2014, CUADERNOS DE INFORMACION Y COMUNICACION, V19, P53, DOI 10.5209/REVCIYC.2014.V19.43903, DOI 10.5209/REVCIYC.2014.V19.43903;FINCHAM K, 2019, MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON, V7, P213, DOI 10.17645/MAC.V7I1.1765;FROEHLICH T., 2020, FAKE NEWS IS BAD NEWS HOAXES, HALF-TRUTHS, AND THE NATURE OF TODAYS JOURNALISM, P13;GARC√çA-OROSA B, 2021, PROF INFORM, V30, DOI 10.3145/EPI.2021.NOV.03;GILLESPIE T, 2010, NEW MEDIA SOC, V12, P347, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342738;G√ìMEZ-GARC√çA S, 2019, COMUNICAR, V27, P49, DOI 10.3916/C59-2019-05;GROSSMAN L., 1995, ELECT REPUBLIC RESHA;HAPPER CATHERINE., 2018, TRUMPS MEDIA WAR, P3;HERN√ÅNDEZ-SERRANO MJ, 2017, COMUNICAR, V25, P77, DOI 10.3916/C50-2017-07;JOURNELL W., 2017, SOCIAL STUDIES J, V37, P8;KAPANTAI E, 2021, NEW MEDIA SOC, V23, P1301, DOI 10.1177/1461444820959296;KAUR M, 2021, J HUM BEHAV SOC ENVI, V31, P362, DOI 10.1080/10911359.2020.1829239;KOTRAS B, 2020, BIG DATA SOC, V7, DOI 10.1177/2053951720951581;LEIDIG EC, 2019, MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON, V7, P77, DOI 10.17645/MAC.V7I1.1629;LOKOT T, 2016, DIGIT JOURNAL, V4, P682, DOI 10.1080/21670811.2015.1081822;LOPEZ-JIMENEZ GLORIA, 2014, REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DEL MUNDO ECONOMICO Y DEL DERECHO, VVII, P69;MACHUS T, 2022, J BEHAV EXP FINANC, V33, DOI 10.1016/J.JBEF.2021.100594;MAGALLON ROSA R., 2018, ESTUDIOS SOBRE EL MENSAJE PERIODISTICO, V24, P273, DOI DOI 10.5209/ESMP.59949;MEEKS L, 2020, J MASS COMMUN Q, V97, P211, DOI 10.1177/1077699019857676;MEIRICK PC, 2022, INT J COMMUN-US, V16, P3379;MENCARELLI A, 2022, PARLIAMENT AFF, V75, P904, DOI 10.1093/PA/GSAB052;MILAN S, 2015, SOC MEDIA SOC, V1, DOI 10.1177/2056305115622481;MISIEJUK KAMILA, 2021, ADVANCES IN QUANTITATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY: SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, ICQE 2020.

This phenomenon leads to new political communication tactics, but also exposes citizens to potentially fraudulent, contaminated or polarised content. In this context, framed in post-truth, the term 'fake news' gains relevance as a way of referring to disinformation and as a political and performative argument that can be weaponised. This research aims to analyse such use in the discourse of the former president Donald Trump during his presidential term (2017-2021), focussing on Twitter as the main platform in his political communication strategy online. To analyse this, we resort to a methodological triangulation of content, discourse, and sentiment analysis, with the latter combining both lexicon and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through machine learning on the basis of deep learning and natural language processing, which is applied to his messages published with the term 'fake news' (N = 768). The analysis of the sample, provided here in an open dataset, employs self-developed software that allows each unit of analysis to be filtered and coded around its predominant themes, sentiments, and words. The main results confirm that Trump's attribution of 'fake news' focusses on three main topics: the media (53%), politics (40%) and his cabinet (33%). It also shows how the former president resorts to a personalist agenda, focussed on the defence of his proposals and his team (80%) by delegitimizing his opponents and the press, with a negative tone (72%) loaded with derogatory terms, confirming a weaponised strategy of the term 'fake news' as a political argument of disinformation and disintermediation.",Disintermediation and disinformation as a political strategy: use of AI to analyse fake news as Trump's rhetorical resource on Twitter,Disinformation; Disintermediation; Fake news; Political communication; Political strategy; Political personalization; Artificial Intelligence; AI; Social networks; Discourse analysis; Sentiment analysis; Twitter; Donald Trump; Deep learning; Machine learning; Natural language processing,UNIVERSIDAD DE VALLADOLID;UNIVERSIDAD DE VALLADOLID,UNIV VALLADOLID,NA,"DIEZ-GRACIA A, 2023, PROF INFORM","DIEZ-GRACIA A, 2023, PROF INFORM"

Algorithmic systems employed on these platforms are presumed to play a role in these phenomena, but little is known about their mechanisms and effects. In this work, we conduct an algorithmic audit of Twitter's Who-To-Follow friend recommendation system, the first empirical audit that investigates the impact of this algorithm in-situ. We create automated Twitter accounts that initially follow left and right affiliated U.S. politicians during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections and then grow their information networks using the platform's recommender system. We pair the experiment with an observational study of Twitter users who already follow the same politicians. Broadly, we find that while following the recommendation algorithm leads accounts into dense and reciprocal neighborhoods that structurally resemble echo chambers, the recommender also results in less political homogeneity of a user's network compared to accounts growing their networks through social endorsement. Furthermore, accounts that exclusively followed users recommended by the algorithm had fewer opportunities to encounter content centered on false or misleading election narratives compared to choosing friends based on social endorsement.",Echo Chambers in the Age of Algorithms: An Audit of Twitter's Friend Recommender System,Social Media; Recommender Systems; Algorithmic Audit,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON;UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE;UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON;UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE,UNIV WASHINGTON,NA,"DUSKIN K, 2024, 16TH ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE, WEBSCIENCE 2024","DUSKIN K, 2024, 16TH ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE, WEBSCIENCE 2024"

This can drastically impact users and the media sector, especially given global risks of misinformation. While the currently discussed European AI Act aims at addressing these risks through Article 52's AI transparency obligations, its interpretation and implications remain unclear. In this early work, we adopt a participatory AI approach to derive key questions based on Article 52's disclosure obligations. We ran two workshops with researchers, designers, and engineers across disciplines (N=16), where participants deconstructed Article 52's relevant clauses using the 5W1H framework. We contribute a set of 149 questions clustered into five themes and 18 sub-themes. We believe these can not only help inform future legal developments and interpretations of Article 52, but also provide a starting point for Human-Computer Interaction research to (re-)examine disclosure transparency from a human-centered AI lens.","Transparent AI Disclosure Obligations: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How",EU AI Act; Article 52; generative artificial intelligence; disclosures; transparency; obligations; law; research questions,UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;KU LEUVEN;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,CTR WISKUNDE AND INFORMAT,NA,"EL ALI A, 2024, EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, CHI 2024","EL ALI A, 2024, EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, CHI 2024"

TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, WE PROPOSE A NEW AI-BASED SOLUTION THAT IDENTIFIES TROLL ACCOUNTS SOLELY THROUGH BEHAVIORAL CUES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SEQUENCES OF SHARING ACTIVITY, ENCOMPASSING BOTH THEIR ACTIONS AND THE FEEDBACK THEY RECEIVE FROM OTHERS. OUR APPROACH DOES NOT INCORPORATE ANY TEXTUAL CONTENT SHARED AND CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: FIRST, WE LEVERAGE AN LSTM-BASED CLASSIFIER TO DETERMINE WHETHER ACCOUNT SEQUENCES BELONG TO A STATE-SPONSORED TROLL OR AN ORGANIC, LEGITIMATE USER. SECOND, WE EMPLOY THE CLASSIFIED SEQUENCES TO CALCULATE A METRIC NAMED THE ""TROLL SCORE"", QUANTIFYING THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN ACCOUNT EXHIBITS TROLL-LIKE BEHAVIOR. TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR METHOD, WE EXAMINE ITS PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 2016 RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE CAMPAIGN DURING THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. OUR EXPERIMENTS YIELD COMPELLING RESULTS, DEMONSTRATING THAT OUR APPROACH CAN IDENTIFY ACCOUNT SEQUENCES WITH AN AUC CLOSE TO 99% AND ACCURATELY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN RUSSIAN TROLLS AND ORGANIC USERS WITH AN AUC OF 91%. NOTABLY, OUR BEHAVIORAL-BASED APPROACH HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE IN THE EVER-EVOLVING LANDSCAPE, WHERE TEXTUAL AND LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES CAN BE EASILY MIMICKED BY LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS): IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING LANGUAGE-BASED TECHNIQUES, IT RELIES ON MORE CHALLENGING-TO-REPLICATE BEHAVIORAL CUES, ENSURING GREATER RESILIENCE IN IDENTIFYING INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE POTENTIAL INCREASE IN THE USAGE OF LLMS FOR GENERATING INAUTHENTIC CONTENT. FINALLY, WE ASSESSED THE GENERALIZABILITY OF OUR SOLUTION TO VARIOUS ENTITIES DRIVING DIFFERENT INFORMATION OPERATIONS AND FOUND PROMISING RESULTS THAT WILL GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH.","EZZEDDINE, FATIMA;AYOUB, OMRAN;GIORDANO, SILVIA;NOGARA, GIANLUCA;SBEITY, IHAB;FERRARA, EMILIO;LUCERI, LUCA","ABOU DAYA A, 2019, 2019 IFIP/IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATED NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT (IM), P144;ADDAWOOD A., 2019, P INT AAAI C WEB SOC, V13, P15, DOI DOI 10.1609/ICWSM.V13I01.3205, 10.1609/ICWSM.V13I01.3205;ALHAZBI S, 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V8, P195132, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033666;ALIZADEH M, 2020, SCI ADV, V6, DOI 10.1126/SCIADV.ABB5824;ALLEM JON-PATRICK, 2017, JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILL, V3, PE98, DOI 10.2196/PUBLICHEALTH.8641;ANONYMOUS, 2020, LANCET INFECT DIS, V20, P875, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30565-X;ARO J., 2016, EUROPEAN VIEW, V15, P121, DOI DOI 10.1007/S12290-016-0395-5;BADAWY A, 2019, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V9, DOI 10.1007/S13278-019-0578-6;BESSI A., 2016, FIRST MONDAY, V21;CARROLL O, 2017, THE INDEPENDENT;CHAVOSHI N, 2016, IEEE DATA MINING, P817, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2016.86, 10.1109/ICDM.2016.0096;CHEN E, 2022, J COMPUT SOC SCI, V5, P1, DOI 10.1007/S42001-021-00117-9;CRESCI S, 2018, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V15, P561, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2017.2681672;DEL VICARIO M, 2016, SCI REP-UK, V6, DOI 10.1038/SREP37825;DRUMNOND C., 2003, ICML KDD 2003 WORKSH;FERRARA E., 2023, FIRST MONDAY;FERRARA E., 2015, ACM SIGWEB NEWSL, V2015, P4, DOI DOI 10.1145/2749279.2749283;FERRARA E, 2022, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2211.05913;FERRARA E, 2020, J COMPUT SOC SCI, V3, P271, DOI 10.1007/S42001-020-00094-5;FERRARA E, 2016, COMMUN ACM, V59, P96, DOI 10.1145/2818717;FROMMER D, 2019, TWITTER'S LIST OF 2,752 RUSSIAN TROLLS;GADDE V., 2020, TWITTER;HU ZW, 2020, J MED INTERNET RES, V22, DOI 10.2196/22639;IM J, 2020, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH ACM CONFERENCE ON WEB SCIENCE, WEBSCI 2020, P1, DOI 10.1145/3394231.3397889;IONIN T, 2008, LINGUA, V118, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.LINGUA.2006.11.012;JACHIM P, 2020, NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS WORKSHOP (NSPW 2020), P59, DOI 10.1145/3442167.3442169;KIM D, 2019, J COMPUT SOC SCI, V2, P331, DOI 10.1007/S42001-019-00051-X;KUDUGUNTA S, 2018, INFORM SCIENCES, V467, P312, DOI 10.1016/J.INS.2018.08.019;LA GATTA V, 2023, 34TH ACM CONFERENCE ON HYPERTEXT AND SOCIAL MEDIA, HT 2023, DOI 10.1145/3603163.3609058;LIU XY, 2009, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V39, P539, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007853;LOPEZ JESSE., 2018, MARCH, V19, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3131087, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3131087;LUCERI L., 2021, FIRST MONDAY;LUCERI L, 2021, THE INTERNET AND THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, V1;LUCERI L., 2019, 1ST MONDAY, V24, DOI DOI 10.5210/FM.V24I9.10213;LUCERI LUCA, 2020, P INT AAAI C WEB SOC, V14, P417;MATAKOS A, 2017, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V31, P1480, DOI 10.1007/S10618-017-0527-9;MAZZA M, 2022, COMPUT COMMUN, V196, P23, DOI 10.1016/J.COMCOM.2022.09.022;MAZZA M, 2019, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH ACM CONFERENCE ON WEB SCIENCE (WEBSCI'19), P183, DOI 10.1145/3292522.3326015;MENCZER F, 2023, NAT MACH INTELL, DOI 10.1038/S42256-023-00690-W;METAXAS P., 2015, P INT AAAI C WEB SOC;METAXAS PT, 2012, SCIENCE, V338, P472, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1230456;MITROVIC S., 2023, ARXIV;MUELLER R.S., 2019, REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION;NICOLAI G, 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 52ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 2, P854;NIELSEN M.A., 2015, NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING, V25;NOGARA G, 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 14TH ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE, WEBSCI 2022, P348, DOI 10.1145/3501247.3531573;NWALA AC, 2023, EPJ DATA SCI, V12, DOI 10.1140/EPJDS/S13688-023-00410-9;PARISER E., 2011, FILTER BUBBLE WHAT I, DOI DOI 10.3139/9783446431164;PHADKE S., 2022, P INT AAAI C WEB SOC, P770, DOI DOI 10.1609/ICWSM.V16I1.19333, 10.1609/ICWSM.V16I1.19333;PIERRI F, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE, WEBSCI 2023, P65, DOI 10.1145/3578503.3583597;PIERRI F, 2023, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2209.07614;PIERRI F, 2022, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2209.01675;PIERRI F, 2022, SCI REP-UK, V12, DOI 10.1038/S41598-022-10070-W;POPKEN B, 2018, NBC NEWS, V14;SAEED M.

To address this challenge, we propose a new AI-based solution that identifies troll accounts solely through behavioral cues associated with their sequences of sharing activity, encompassing both their actions and the feedback they receive from others. Our approach does not incorporate any textual content shared and consists of two steps: First, we leverage an LSTM-based classifier to determine whether account sequences belong to a state-sponsored troll or an organic, legitimate user. Second, we employ the classified sequences to calculate a metric named the ""Troll Score"", quantifying the degree to which an account exhibits troll-like behavior. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we examine its performance in the context of the 2016 Russian interference campaign during the U.S. Presidential election. Our experiments yield compelling results, demonstrating that our approach can identify account sequences with an AUC close to 99% and accurately differentiate between Russian trolls and organic users with an AUC of 91%. Notably, our behavioral-based approach holds a significant advantage in the ever-evolving landscape, where textual and linguistic properties can be easily mimicked by Large Language Models (LLMs): In contrast to existing language-based techniques, it relies on more challenging-to-replicate behavioral cues, ensuring greater resilience in identifying influence campaigns, especially given the potential increase in the usage of LLMs for generating inauthentic content. Finally, we assessed the generalizability of our solution to various entities driving different information operations and found promising results that will guide future research.",Exposing influence campaigns in the age of LLMs: a behavioral-based AI approach to detecting state-sponsored trolls,Social network; Troll; Misinformation,LEBANESE UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,UNIV APPL SCI AND ARTS SOUTHERN SWITZERLAND;LEBANESE UNIV,NA,"EZZEDDINE F, 2023, EPJ DATA SCI","EZZEDDINE F, 2023, EPJ DATA SCI"

A significant portion of this data includes opinions and perspectives which, on one hand, celebrate democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure political biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.

While artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to craft compelling and valuable information campaigns with positive repercussions for public health and democracy, concerns have arisen regarding the potential use of AI systems to generate convincing disinformation. The consequences of this dual nature of AI, capable of both illuminating and obscuring the information landscape, are complex and multifaceted. We contend that the rapid integration of AI into society demands a comprehensive understanding of its ethical implications and the development of strategies to harness its potential for the greater good while mitigating harm. Thus, in this paper we explore the ethical dimensions of AI's role in information dissemination and impact on public health, arguing that potential strategies to deal with AI and disinformation encompass generating regulated and transparent data sets used to train AI models, regulating content outputs, and promoting information literacy.",The Dual Nature of AI in Information Dissemination: Ethical Considerations,AI; bioethics; infodemic management; disinformation; artificial intelligence; ethics; ethical; infodemic; infodemics; public health; misinformation; information dissemination; information literacy,UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH,UNIV ZURICH,NA,"GERMANI F, 2024, JMIR AI","GERMANI F, 2024, JMIR AI"

BRIGADA DIGITAL DE SALUD WAS ESTABLISHED TO DISSEMINATE CREDIBLE, SCIENCE -BASED INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 IN SPANISH ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS PARTICIPANTS' REACTIONS TO AND ENGAGEMENT WITH BRIGADA DIGITAL CONTENT THAT SOUGHT TO INCREASE COVID-19 VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG US LATINO PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A 5 -WEEK INTERVENTION IN A PRIVATE, MODERATOR -LED FACEBOOK (META PLATFORMS, INC) GROUP WITH SPANISH-SPEAKING LATINO PARENTS OF CHILDREN AGED <= 18 YEARS (N=55). THE INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED 3 TO 4 DAILY BRIGADA DIGITAL POSTS AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS THE COVERED TOPICS THROUGH COMMENTS AND POLLS. TO ASSESS PARTICIPANTS' EXPOSURE, REACTIONS, AND ENGAGEMENT, WE USED PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES TO A WEB -BASED SURVEY ADMINISTERED AT 2 TIME POINTS (BASELINE AND AFTER 5 WEEKS) AND FACEBOOK ANALYTICS TO CALCULATE THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANT VIEWS, REACTIONS, AND COMMENTS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE ASSESSED FOR QUANTITATIVE SURVEY ITEMS, QUALITATIVE RESPONSES WERE THEMATICALLY ANALYZED, AND QUOTES WERE SELECTED TO ILLUSTRATE THE THEMES. RESULTS: OVERALL, 101 POSTS WERE PUBLISHED. MOST PARTICIPANTS REPORTED VISITING THE GROUP 1 TO 3 TIMES (22/55, 40%) OR 4 TO 6 (18/55, 33%) TIMES PER WEEK AND VIEWING 1 TO 2 (23/55, 42%) OR 3 TO 4 (16/55, 29%) POSTS PER DAY. FACEBOOK ANALYTICS VALIDATED THIS EXPOSURE, WITH 36 VIEWS PER PARTICIPANT ON AVERAGE. THE PARTICIPANTS REACTED POSITIVELY TO THE INTERVENTION. MOST PARTICIPANTS FOUND THE CONTENT INFORMATIVE AND TRUSTWORTHY (49/55, 89%), EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AND PRESENTED IN AN INTERESTING MANNER. THE PARTICIPANTS THOUGHT THAT THE MODERATORS WERE WELL INFORMED (51/55, 93%) AND HELPFUL (50/55, 91%) AND PRAISED THEM FOR BEING EMPATHIC AND RESPONSIVE. THE PARTICIPANTS VIEWED THE GROUP ENVIRONMENT AS WELCOMING AND GROUP MEMBERS AS FRIENDLY (45/55, 82%) AND SUPPORTIVE (19/55, 35%). THE 3 MOST USEFUL TOPICS FOR PARTICIPANTS WERE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF ADULT COVID-19 VACCINES (29/55, 53%), UNDERSTANDING CHILD RISK LEVELS (29/55, 53%), AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND COVID-19 (24/55, 44%). THE PREFERRED FORMATS WERE EDUCATIONAL POSTS THAT COULD BE READ (38/55, 69%) AND VIDEOS, INCLUDING EXPERT (28/55, 51%) AND INSTRUCTIONAL (26/55, 47%) INTERVIEWS. REGARDING ENGAGEMENT, MOST PARTICIPANTS SELF -REPORTED REACTING TO POSTS 1 TO 2 (16/55, 29%) OR 3 TO 4 (15/55, 27%) TIMES PER WEEK AND COMMENTING ON POSTS 1 TO 2 (16/55, 29%) OR <1 (20/55, 36%) TIME PER WEEK. THIS ENGAGEMENT LEVEL WAS VALIDATED BY ANALYTICS, WITH 10.6 REACTIONS AND 3 COMMENTS PER PARTICIPANT, ON AVERAGE, DURING THE 5 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS RECOMMENDED MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT, SUCH AS INTERACTING WITH THE MODERATORS IN REAL TIME.

Brigada Digital de Salud was established to disseminate credible, science -based information about COVID-19 in Spanish on social media. Objective: This study aims to assess participants' reactions to and engagement with Brigada Digital content that sought to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among US Latino parents and their children. Methods: We conducted a 5 -week intervention in a private, moderator -led Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc) group with Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children aged <= 18 years (N=55). The intervention participants received 3 to 4 daily Brigada Digital posts and were encouraged to discuss the covered topics through comments and polls. To assess participants' exposure, reactions, and engagement, we used participants' responses to a web -based survey administered at 2 time points (baseline and after 5 weeks) and Facebook analytics to calculate the average number of participant views, reactions, and comments. Descriptive statistics were assessed for quantitative survey items, qualitative responses were thematically analyzed, and quotes were selected to illustrate the themes. Results: Overall, 101 posts were published. Most participants reported visiting the group 1 to 3 times (22/55, 40%) or 4 to 6 (18/55, 33%) times per week and viewing 1 to 2 (23/55, 42%) or 3 to 4 (16/55, 29%) posts per day. Facebook analytics validated this exposure, with 36 views per participant on average. The participants reacted positively to the intervention. Most participants found the content informative and trustworthy (49/55, 89%), easy to understand, and presented in an interesting manner. The participants thought that the moderators were well informed (51/55, 93%) and helpful (50/55, 91%) and praised them for being empathic and responsive. The participants viewed the group environment as welcoming and group members as friendly (45/55, 82%) and supportive (19/55, 35%). The 3 most useful topics for participants were the safety and efficacy of adult COVID-19 vaccines (29/55, 53%), understanding child risk levels (29/55, 53%), and the science behind COVID-19 (24/55, 44%). The preferred formats were educational posts that could be read (38/55, 69%) and videos, including expert (28/55, 51%) and instructional (26/55, 47%) interviews. Regarding engagement, most participants self -reported reacting to posts 1 to 2 (16/55, 29%) or 3 to 4 (15/55, 27%) times per week and commenting on posts 1 to 2 (16/55, 29%) or <1 (20/55, 36%) time per week. This engagement level was validated by analytics, with 10.6 reactions and 3 comments per participant, on average, during the 5 weeks. Participants recommended more opportunities for engagement, such as interacting with the moderators in real time. Conclusions: With adequate intervention exposure and engagement and overall positive participant reactions, the findings highlight the promise of this digital approach for COVID-19 vaccine-related health promotion.",Latino Parents' Reactions to and Engagement With a Facebook Group-Based COVID-19 Vaccine Promotion Intervention: Mixed Methods Pilot Study,COVID-19; misinformation; social media; Latino parents; Spanish; vaccines; digital intervention,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM;CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIV,NA,"GONZ√ÅLEZ-SALINAS AI, 2024, JMIR FORM RES","GONZ√ÅLEZ-SALINAS AI, 2024, JMIR FORM RES"

WE DISCOVERED THAT A HIGH NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS POSTING IN TAGALOG WERE SUSPENDED AS PART OF TWITTER'S CRACKDOWN ON INTERFERENCE OPERATIONS AFTER THE 2016 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BY COMBINING TEXT EMBEDDING AND TRANSFER LEARNING, OUR FRAMEWORK CAN DETECT, WITH PROMISING ACCURACY, MALICIOUS USERS POSTING IN TAGALOG WITHOUT ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR TRAINING ON MALICIOUS CONTENT IN THAT LANGUAGE. WE FIRST LEARN AN EMBEDDING MODEL FOR EACH LANGUAGE, NAMELY A HIGH-RESOURCE LANGUAGE (ENGLISH) AND A LOW-RESOURCE ONE (TAGALOG), INDEPENDENTLY. THEN, WE LEARN A MAPPING BETWEEN THE TWO LATENT SPACES TO TRANSFER THE DETECTION MODEL.

disinformation. Most research focuses on high-resource languages. However, malicious actors share content across countries and languages, including low-resource ones. Here, we investigate whether and to what extent malicious actors can be detected in low-resource language settings. We discovered that a high number of accounts posting in Tagalog were suspended as part of Twitter's crackdown on interference operations after the 2016 US Presidential election. By combining text embedding and transfer learning, our framework can detect, with promising accuracy, malicious users posting in Tagalog without any prior knowledge or training on malicious content in that language. We first learn an embedding model for each language, namely a high-resource language (English) and a low-resource one (Tagalog), independently. Then, we learn a mapping between the two latent spaces to transfer the detection model. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and yields marked advantages in settings with very limited training datathe norm when dealing with detecting malicious activity in online platforms.",Detecting Social Media Manipulation in Low-Resource Languages,social media; disinformation; language processing,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,UNIV SOUTHERN CALIF,NA,"HAIDER S, 2023, COMPANION OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE, WWW 2023","HAIDER S, 2023, COMPANION OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE, WWW 2023"

OUR WORK TRIES TO DEFINE ITS SCOPE AND FOCUSES ON A POPULAR SUBAREA OF IT, NAMELY ""DIGITAL DEMOCRACY"". IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST IN USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO PROMOTE MORE PARTICIPATORY FORMS OF DEMOCRACY. WHILE THERE ARE NUMEROUS POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO USING DIGITAL TOOLS TO ENHANCE DEMOCRACY, SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES MUST BE ADDRESSED. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN AN ACCESSIBLE, EQUITABLE, AND FAIR MANNER RATHER THAN REINFORCING EXISTING POWER IMBALANCES. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW DIGITAL TOOLS CAN BE USED TO HELP DESIGN MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES BY INVESTIGATING THREE KEY RESEARCH AREAS: (1) THE ROLE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR FACILITATING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING; (2) THE USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNANCE; AND (3) THE POTENTIAL FOR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE THE FORMATION OF MORE INCLUSIVE AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACIES. WE ARGUE THAT MORE RESEARCH ON HOW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY UPGRADE IS NEEDED. ALONG THESE LINES, WE LAY OUT A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE.","HELBING, DIRK;MAHAJAN, SACHIT;FRICKER, REGULA HANGGLI;MUSSO, ANDREA;HAUSLADEN, CARINA I.;CARISSIMO, CESARE;CARPENTRAS, DINO;STOCKINGER, ELISABETH;SANCHEZ-VAQUERIZO, JAVIER ARGOTA;YANG, JOSHUA C.;BALLANDIES, MARK C.;KORECKI, MARCIN;DUBEY, ROHIT K.;POURNARAS, EVANGELOS","ACUTO M, 2017, GLOB POLICY, V8, P14, DOI 10.1111/1758-5899.12382;ALEMANNO A, 2018, EUR J RISK REGUL, V9, P1, DOI 10.1017/ERR.2018.12;ANONYMOUS, 2016, P 2016 CHI C EXTENDE, DOI 10.1145/2851581.2886436, DOI 10.1145/2851581.2886436;ANONYMOUS, ?ABOUT US"";ANONYMOUS, MARRIAGES DEMOCRATS;ARANA-CATANIA MIGUEL, 2021, ACM DIGITAL GOVERNMENT: RESEARCH AND PRACTICE, V2, DOI 10.1145/3452118;ARBATLI E, 2021, DEMOCRATIZATION, V28, P285, DOI 10.1080/13510347.2020.1818068;ASIKIS T, 2021, ROY SOC OPEN SCI, V8, DOI 10.1098/RSOS.201418;ASIKIS T, 2020, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V109, P488, DOI 10.1016/J.FUTURE.2018.07.018;BALLANDIES M.C., 2021, ECIS 2021 P;BALLANDIES MC, 2023, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2203.15254;BALLANDIES MC, 2022, IEEE ACCESS, V10, P74111, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3189774;BALLANDIES MC, 2022, CLUSTER COMPUT, V25, P1817, DOI 10.1007/S10586-021-03256-W;BARANDIARAN X.E., 2018, CISC VIS NETW IND GL;BATTY M, 2018, ENVIRON PLAN B-URBAN, V45, P817, DOI 10.1177/2399808318796416;BAUER A, 2009, INT J SOC ROBOT, V1, P127, DOI 10.1007/S12369-009-0011-9;BECKAGE B, 2013, EMERGENCE, COMPLEXITY AND COMPUTATION, P79, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-35482-3_7, 10.1007/978-3-642-35482-3_7;BENADE G., 2018, EFFICIENCY AND USABILITY OF PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING METHODS;BERNAYS EL, 1947, ANN AM ACAD POLIT SS, V250, P113, DOI 10.1177/000271624725000116;BONABEAU E., 1999, SWARM INTELLIGENCE: FROM NATURAL TO ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS;BULKELEY H, 2016, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V22, P13, DOI 10.1016/J.COSUST.2017.02.003;BUNDESINSTITUT FUR BAU-STADT UND RAUMFORSCHUNG, SMART CIT CHART MAK;CALINESCU R, 2019, 2019 IEEE/ACM 5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR SMART CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (SESCPS 2019), P2, DOI 10.1109/SESCPS.2019.00008;CHADZYNSKI A, 2022, ENERGY AI, V8, DOI 10.1016/J.EGYAI.2022.100137;CHESTER MV, 2019, SUSTAIN RESIL INFRAS, V4, P173, DOI 10.1080/23789689.2017.1416846;CHWALISZ C., 2019, CARNEGIE EUROPE, V26, P1;COBO MJ, 2011, J INFORMETR, V5, P146, DOI 10.1016/J.JOI.2010.10.002;CONTE R, 2012, EUR PHYS J-SPEC TOP, V214, P325, DOI 10.1140/EPJST/E2012-01697-8;CONTUCCI P., 2019, INTERDISCIPLINARY AP, P101;JIM√âNEZ AC, 2014, ENVIRON PLANN D, V32, P342, DOI 10.1068/D13077P;DA SILVA CF, 2021, TELEMAT INFORM, V60, DOI 10.1016/J.TELE.2021.101593;DAHLBERG L, 2011, NEW MEDIA SOC, V13, P855, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389569;DAMIAN I, 2022, SENSORS-BASEL, V22, DOI 10.3390/S22124515;DAPP M.M., 2018, BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION THROUGH BLOCKCHAIN, V2, P153;DAPP M.M., 2021, FINANCE 4 0 TOWARDS;DAVIDSON K, 2019, URBAN STUD, V56, P3540, DOI 10.1177/0042098018816010;(DE) TOCQUEVILLE ALEXIS., 1838, DEMOCRACY AM;DE ZIGA HG, 2010, J INF TECHNOL POLITI, V7, P36, DOI 10.1080/19331680903316742;DIAS N., 2021, PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING WORLD ATLAS 2020 - 2021;DIMITRI N, 2022, INFORMATION, V13, DOI 10.3390/INFO13060305;FALLIS D., 2014, PHILOS INFORM QUALIT, P135, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-07121-3_8;FELDMAN MP, 1999, EUR ECON REV, V43, P409, DOI 10.1016/S0014-2921(98)00047-6;FETZER JH, 2004, MIND MACH, V14, P231, DOI 10.1023/B:MIND.0000021683.28604.5B;FIORINA MP, 2008, ANNU REV POLIT SCI, V11, P563, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.POLISCI.11.053106.153836;FOSTER ME, 2016, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V9979, P753, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-47437-3_74;FRIEDMAN B, 2019, VALUE SENSITIVE DESIGN: SHAPING TECHNOLOGY WITH MORAL IMAGINATION, P1, DOI 10.7551/MITPRESS/7585.001.0001;GABRYS J., 2021, CITIZEN SCI PUBLIC P, P88;GAVENTA J, 2002, IDS BULL-I DEV STUD, V33, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1759-5436.2002.TB00020.X;GIBSON JJ, 1978, LEONARDO, V11, P227, DOI 10.2307/1574154;GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATION SERVICE, RESIST 2 COUNT DIS T;GRECH P.D., NEGOTIATION ENG COMP;GROULX M, 2017, SCI COMMUN, V39, P45, DOI 10.1177/1075547016688324;GRUND T., 2013, SCI REP-UK, V3, P1;GU√âRIAU M, 2020, IEEE INT C INTELL TR, DOI 10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294174;HACKER K., 2000, DIGITAL DEMOCRACY, ISSUES OF THEORY AND PRACTICE, DOI 10.4135/9781446218891;HAGUE B N., 2005, DIGITAL DEMOCRACY: DISCOURSE AND DECISION MAKING IN THE INFORMATION AGE;HANGGLI R, 2020, CHALLEN DEMOCR 21ST, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-26582-3;HANSON JULIENNE., 2004, THE INCLUSIVE CITY: DELIVERING A MORE ACCESSIBLE URBAN ENVIRONMENT TROUGH INCLUSIVE DESIGN;HAUSLADEN C.

Our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely ""Digital Democracy"". In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future.","Democracy by Design: Perspectives for Digitally Assisted, Participatory Upgrades of Society",Computational diplomacy; Digital democracy; Participation; Collective intelligence; Value -based engineering,SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN;ETH ZURICH;UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS;UNIVERSITY OF FRIBOURG,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,NA,"HELBING D, 2023, J COMPUT SCI-NETH","HELBING D, 2023, J COMPUT SCI-NETH"

RUSSIA'S OCCUPATION OF THE ZAPORIZHZHIA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT (ZNPP), EUROPE'S LARGEST SUCH FACILITY, RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT USING NPPS IN CRISIS AND RISK COMMUNICATION, AND DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. BUILDING UPON INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH BRIDGING COMMUNICATION AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS STUDIES, THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS CONTENT ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE HOW UKRAINIAN AND RUSSIAN MEDIA OUTLETS ENGAGED IN A RHETORICAL BATTLE OF FRAME PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE RELATED TO ZNPP.

Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe's largest such facility, raises fundamental questions about using NPPs in crisis and risk communication, and disinformation campaigns. Building upon interdisciplinary research bridging Communication and International Relations Studies, this article employs content analysis to examine how Ukrainian and Russian media outlets engaged in a rhetorical battle of frame perceptions about the threat of nuclear catastrophe related to ZNPP. They explore how Russia's propagandists used news media to stir nuclear anxiety as part of a broader disinformation campaign, and investigate strategies employed by Ukrainian media agencies to manage the risk of nuclear anxiety and respond to Russian disinformation. The article contributes to conversations in the field of crisis and risk communication related to how political stakeholders use news media to influence audiences' perceptions, and specifically how political actors use nuclear anxiety politicization and disinformation to gain political influence. The findings provide insights into developing effective news media strategies responding to threats of large-scale nuclear, biological, or chemical catastrophes and cyber-attacks on nuclear infrastructure.",Nuclear anxiety as an instrument of war: The use of news media to shape and respond to the disinformation campaign surrounding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,"nuclear politics; crisis communication; risk communication; Russia-Ukraine war; strategic narratives, AI-enhanced methodologies",EMBRY-RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY,EMBRY RIDDLE AERONAUT UNIV WORLDWIDE,NA,"HOBAN I, 2025, MEDIA WAR CONFL","HOBAN I, 2025, MEDIA WAR CONFL"

USERS' EXPOSURE TO YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON- AND OFF-PLATFORM,"YOUTUBE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PLATFORMS ON THE INTERNET. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT JUST A SINGULAR DESTINATION: BECAUSE YOUTUBE VIDEOS MAY BE EMBEDDED INTO ANY WEBSITE, IT IS A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR THE ENTIRE WEB. UNFORTUNATELY, EXISTING STUDIES DO NOT EXAMINE PLAYABLE YOUTUBE VIDEOS EMBEDDED AROUND THE WEB, INSTEAD FOCUSING SOLELY ON ON-PLATFORM ENGAGEMENT. IN THIS STUDY WE PRESENT THE FIRST COMPARISON OF ON- AND OFF-PLATFORM PLAYABLE YOUTUBE VIDEO EXPOSURE ON THE DESKTOP WEB, BASED ON DATA FROM A SAMPLE OF N = 1133 U. S. RESIDENTS FROM THREE COHORTS: DEMOGRAPHICALLY REPRESENTATIVE USERS, HEAVY YOUTUBE USERS, AND USERS WITH HIGH RACIAL RESENTMENT. OUR DATASET INCLUDES THE URLS OF ALL PLAYABLE YOUTUBE VIDEOS ENCOUNTERED BY PARTICIPANTS FOR SIX MONTHS-ON YOUTUBE ITSELF OR EMBEDDED IN ANOTHER WEBSITE-AND THE URLS WHERE THE VIDEOS WERE ENCOUNTERED. BY ANALYZING THIS DATA, WE FIND THAT LESS POPULAR WEBSITES TEND TO EMBED YOUTUBE VIDEOS IN A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR WEBPAGES AND THAT INDIVIDUALS ENCOUNTER MORE YOUTUBE VIDEOS OFF-PLATFORM THAN ON-PLATFORM. WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT MOST YOUTUBE CHANNELS ONLY RECEIVE EXPOSURE FROM EITHER ON- OR OFF-PLATFORM SOURCES, AND THAT ONLY-OFF-PLATFORM CHANNELS TEND TO GET MORE EXPOSURE THAN ONLY-ON-PLATFORM ONES. THESE RESULTS UNDERSCORE THE WIDE REACH OF YOUTUBE AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE WEB AND THE LIMITATIONS OF STUDIES FOCUSING SOLELY ON ON-PLATFORM ACTIVITY. MOTIVATED BY CONCERNS ABOUT ONLINE MISINFORMATION AND HATE SPEECH, WE ALSO EXAMINE HOW PARTISAN WEBSITES EMBED PLAYABLE YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND WHERE VIDEOS FROM PROBLEMATIC CHANNELS APPEAR AROUND THE WEB. WE FIND THAT POLITICALLY RIGHT-LEANING WEBSITES TEND TO EMBED MORE VIDEOS FROM PROBLEMATIC YOUTUBE CHANNELS THAN CENTRIST OR LEFT-LEANING WEBSITES, AND THAT PARTICIPANTS EXPOSED TO OFF-PLATFORM VIDEOS FROM PROBLEMATIC CHANNELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INCLINED TO BROWSE TOWARDS ON-PLATFORM VIDEOS FROM PROBLEMATIC CHANNELS.","HU, DESHENG;ROBERTSON, RONALD E.;HANNAK, ANIKO;WILSON, CHRISTO","ABISHEVA A,

However, it is not just a singular destination: because YouTube videos may be embedded into any website, it is a systemically important platform for the entire web. Unfortunately, existing studies do not examine playable YouTube videos embedded around the web, instead focusing solely on on-platform engagement. In this study we present the first comparison of on- and off-platform playable YouTube video exposure on the desktop web, based on data from a sample of n = 1133 U. S. residents from three cohorts: demographically representative users, heavy YouTube users, and users with high racial resentment. Our dataset includes the URLs of all playable YouTube videos encountered by participants for six months-on YouTube itself or embedded in another website-and the URLs where the videos were encountered. By analyzing this data, we find that less popular websites tend to embed YouTube videos in a disproportionately large percentage of their webpages and that individuals encounter more YouTube videos off-platform than on-platform. We also observe that most YouTube channels only receive exposure from either on- or off-platform sources, and that only-off-platform channels tend to get more exposure than only-on-platform ones. These results underscore the wide reach of YouTube as a service provider for the web and the limitations of studies focusing solely on on-platform activity. Motivated by concerns about online misinformation and hate speech, we also examine how partisan websites embed playable YouTube videos and where videos from problematic channels appear around the web. We find that politically right-leaning websites tend to embed more videos from problematic YouTube channels than centrist or left-leaning websites, and that participants exposed to off-platform videos from problematic channels are significantly more inclined to browse towards on-platform videos from problematic channels.",U.

HOWEVER, THIS FREEDOM IS USED TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION AND DISRUPT SOCIETAL HARMONY. TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION AND FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, MULTIFARIOUS AI APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DETECT SUCH CONTENT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND DATA MODALITIES, INCLUDING TEXT, IMAGES, AND VIDEOS. TO ESTABLISH A DISTINCTIVE PLATFORM THAT FOSTERS THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF AI-DRIVEN FAKE NEWS DETECTORS, RESEARCHERS HAVE PUBLISHED SEVERAL REVIEW ARTICLES IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE ARTICLES ARE OUTDATED, AND LACK COMPREHENSIVENESS, PARTICULARLY REGARDING RECENT TRENDS, PUBLIC DATASETS, REPRESENTATION LEARNING METHODS, AND CLASSIFIERS DETAILS. THE LIMITED SCOPE OF ARTICLES HINDERED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION ON PREDICTORS' LANGUAGE SPECIFICITY, DATA MODALITY FOCUS, AND STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE ACROSS DIVERSE LANGUAGES. THIS PAPER OFFERS A UNIQUE PLATFORM WITH DETAILED INFORMATION ON THESE ASPECTS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. IT OFFERS A DETAILED ROADMAP FOR UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE, STRENGTHS, AND LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING REVIEW ARTICLES ON THE SUBJECT. TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BENCHMARK DATASETS AND MORE ACCURATE PREDICTORS, IT CONDUCTS AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE DEFINITIONS AND PERSPECTIVES OF FAKE NEWS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF EXISTING LITERATURE. THIS ANALYSIS PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DEFINITION AND BASIC CONCEPTS OF FAKE NEWS. IN ADDITION, 310 FAKE NEWS DETECTION ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 8 YEARS HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE OF THESE ARTICLES, THE STUDY PRESENTS DETAILS OF LANGUAGES, DATASETS, DATA MODALITIES, PREDICTOR ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, AND THEIR PERFORMANCE METRICS.","HUSSAIN, FIZA GULZAR;WASIM, MUHAMMAD;HAMEED, SEEMAB;REHMAN, ABDUR;ASIM, MUHAMMAD NABEEL;DENGEL, ANDREAS","ABID-ALTHAQAFI NR, 2024, IEEE ACCESS, V12, P8471, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3353312;ABU SALEM FK, 2021, PATTERNS, V2, DOI 10.1016/J.PATTER.2021.100369;ABUALIGAH L, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V14, DOI 10.1007/S13278-024-01198-W;AGARWAL A., 2020, SN COMPUT SCI, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.1007/S42979-020-00165-4, 10.1007/S42979-020-00165-4;AGARWAL IY, 2022, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V12, DOI 10.1007/S13278-022-00887-8;AGARWAL I, 2023, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, DOI 10.1007/S11042-023-17465-5;AGRAWAL C, 2022, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V81, P24199, DOI 10.1007/S11042-022-12772-9;AGUILERA A, 2023, IEEE ACCESS, V11, P108365, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3320687;AHMED H, 2018, SECUR PRIVACY, V1, DOI 10.1002/SPY2.9;A√èMEUR E, 2023, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V13, DOI 10.1007/S13278-023-01028-5;AKER AHMET, 2019, ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MEDIA, V13, P59, DOI 10.1016/J.OSNEM.2019.07.001;AL GHAMDI MA, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V83, P30095, DOI 10.1007/S11042-023-16669-Z;AL-GHADIR AI, 2021, INFORM FUSION, V67, P29, DOI 10.1016/J.INFFUS.2020.10.003;ALBRIGHT J., 2016, MEDIUMNOV;ALGHAMDI J, 2023, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V274, DOI 10.1016/J.KNOSYS.2023.110642;ALI G, 2023, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V82, P7017, DOI 10.1007/S11042-022-13595-4;ALJAWARNEH SA, 2024, IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY, V11, P4843, DOI 10.1109/TCSS.2022.3223786;ALJREES T, 2024, IEEE ACCESS, V12, P63066, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3392297;ALLCOTT H, 2017, J ECON PERSPECT, V31, P211, DOI 10.1257/JEP.31.2.211;ALLEIN L, 2023, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V60, DOI 10.1016/J.IPM.2022.103206;AMAAR A, 2022, NEURAL PROCESS LETT, V54, P2219, DOI 10.1007/S11063-021-10727-Z;ANOOP K., 2020, P 24 S INT DAT ENG A, P1;ANSAR W., 2021, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V1, P100052, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.JJIMEI.2021.100052;ASHFORTH BE, 1989, ACAD MANAGE REV, V14, P20, DOI 10.2307/258189;ASIM MN, 2022, ISCIENCE, V25, DOI 10.1016/J.ISCI.2022.105169;ASIM MN, 2022, COMPUT STRUCT BIOTEC, V20, P3986, DOI 10.1016/J.CSBJ.2022.07.031;ASIM MN, 2020, IEEE IJCNN, DOI 10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206892;ASIM MN, 2021, IEEE ACCESS, V9, P19379, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037642;AYOUB J, 2021, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V58, DOI 10.1016/J.IPM.2021.102569;BAHMANYAR RAZIEH, 2024, 2024 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB RESEARCH (ICWR), P364, DOI 10.1109/ICWR61162.2024.10533339;BALASUBRAMANIAM T, 2021, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V11, DOI 10.1007/S13278-021-00767-7;BALSHETWAR SV, 2023, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V82, P35781, DOI 10.1007/S11042-023-14883-3;BARNAB√í G, 2023, ONLINE SOC NETW MED, V33, DOI 10.1016/J.OSNEM.2023.100244;PEREIRA FB, 2022, J POLIT, V84, P2188, DOI 10.1086/719419;BEAUVAIS C, 2022, JOINT BONE SPINE, V89, DOI 10.1016/J.JBSPIN.2022.105371;BEER DYLAN, 2021, INTEGRATED SCIENCE IN DIGITAL AGE 2020.

However, this freedom is used to spread misinformation and disrupt societal harmony. To combat misinformation and fake news on social media platforms, multifarious AI applications have been developed to detect such content in various languages and data modalities, including text, images, and videos. To establish a distinctive platform that fosters the rapid development of AI-driven fake news detectors, researchers have published several review articles in recent years. However, many of these articles are outdated, and lack comprehensiveness, particularly regarding recent trends, public datasets, representation learning methods, and classifiers details. The limited scope of articles hindered their ability to provide in-depth information on predictors' language specificity, data modality focus, and state-of-the-art performance across diverse languages. This paper offers a unique platform with detailed information on these aspects to address this gap. It offers a detailed roadmap for understanding the scope, strengths, and limitations of existing review articles on the subject. To support the development of new benchmark datasets and more accurate predictors, it conducts an in-depth analysis of the definitions and perspectives of fake news within the context of existing literature. This analysis provides a more comprehensive definition and basic concepts of fake news. In addition, 310 fake news detection articles published in the last 8 years have been thoroughly investigated. Within the landscape of these articles, the study presents details of languages, datasets, data modalities, predictor architecture designs, and their performance metrics.","Fake News Detection Landscape: Datasets, Data Modalities, AI Approaches, Their Challenges, and Future Perspectives",Fake news; Social networking (online); Surveys; Reviews; Computer science; Feature extraction; Economics; Blogs; Voting; Source coding; Text-based fake news detection; image-based fake news detection; large language models; GPT4; systematic review; embeddings,UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY (UMT);UNIVERSITY OF GUJRAT,UNIV MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOL;GERMAN RES CTR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,NA,"HUSSAIN FG, 2025, IEEE ACCESS","HUSSAIN FG, 2025, IEEE ACCESS"

SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AI CAN HAVE ON DEMOCRACY, QUALITY OF EDUCATION, SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, ETC.

The goal is to research how young people understand the threats and benefits of AI and what can be done to eliminate risks related to it. Survey results show that young people are concerned about the negative impacts AI can have on democracy, quality of education, spread of misinformation, etc. On the other hand, participants mention numerous positive opportunities coming from AI. Need for regulations for sustainable AI development is also discussed. Most of the respondents say that AI should be regulated by the government to ensure safe and ethical usage of it. Connections between the AI and Sustainable Development Goals from the perspective of the youth are drawn to tackle challenges and highlight opportunities.",Threats and Benefits of AI in the context of targeting SDGs: A Youth Perception Approach,artificial intelligence; youth perspective; sustainable developmentgoals; technologies development,MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE OF UKRAINE;TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV;MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE OF UKRAINE;ZAPORIZHZHIA POLYTECHNIC NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE OF UKRAINE;BORYS GRINCHENKO KYIV METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY,TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATL UNIV KYIV,NA,"ISOIEVA M, 2024, EUR J SUSTAIN DEV","ISOIEVA M, 2024, EUR J SUSTAIN DEV"

THIS STUDY AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS BY DEVELOPING A NOVEL METHODOLOGY FOR THE DETECTION OF SPAMBOTS AND FAKE FOLLOWERS USING ANNOTATED DATA. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE AN INTERPRETABLE MACHINE LEARNING (ML) FRAMEWORK, LEVERAGING MULTIPLE ML ALGORITHMS WITH HYPERPARAMETERS OPTIMIZED THROUGH CROSS-VALIDATION, TO ENHANCE THE DETECTION PROCESS. FURTHERMORE, WE ANALYZE SEVERAL FEATURES AND PROVIDE A UNIQUE FEATURE SET THAT IS OPTIMIZED TO OFFER EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE FOR BOT DETECTION. MOREOVER, WE UTILIZE MULTIPLE INTERPRETABLE AI TECHNIQUES WHICH INCLUDE SHAPLEY ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS (SHAP) AND LOCAL INTERPRETABLE MODEL-AGNOSTIC EXPLANATIONS (LIME). SHAP WILL HELP TO DISPLAY THE EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS ON THE MODEL'S PREDICTION WHICH WILL HELP IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN ACCOUNT IS A BOT OR A LEGITIMATE USER. LIME WILL HELP TO COMPREHEND THE MODEL'S PREDICTIONS, OFFERING CLARITY REGARDING THE TRAITS OR ATTRIBUTES THAT DRIVE THE CLASSIFICATION CONCLUSION.

LIME allows researchers to detect bot-like activity in social networks by generating locally faithful explanations for each prediction. Our model offers enhanced interpretability by clearly highlighting the impact of various features used for spam and fake follower detection when compared to existing state-of-the-art social network bot detection systems.

Building on the theoretical framework of the green public sphere, this study aims to explore the features of the content (topics and veracity), the characteristics of engaged users (regular users and social bots), and the communication strategies adopted by engaged users in climate change discussions on Chinese social media. We employed machine learning methods to analyze 452,167 climate change-related posts generated by 311,214 users from 2010 to 2020 on Weibo, finding that climate change discourse concentrated on environmental and health impacts and action advocacy, and misinformation was not prevalent. Regarding the composition of engaged users, only a small proportion were social bots which concentrated on action advocacy and politics and governance, rather than skeptical and denialist discourses. In terms of communication strategies, we found that social bots on Weibo were more likely to forward a post or mention another user than regular users. This study expands our understanding of climate change discourse and the green public sphere on social media and provides insights into leveraging social bots in climate change communication in an AI-powered society.",Exploring the climate change discourse on Chinese social media and the role of social bots,Climate change; public discourse; topics; misinformation; social bots; social media; green public sphere,"CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA, CAS;CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA, CAS;CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA, CAS;CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA, CAS",UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL CHINA;UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL CHINA;UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL CHINA,NA,"JI JJ, 2024, ASIAN J COMMUN","JI JJ, 2024, ASIAN J COMMUN"

OUR FINDINGS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH 30 SPANISH SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, SHOW HOW THE CENTRALITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN CITIZENS' EVERYDAY LIFE NUDGES THEM INTO A PERSUASIVE RELATIONSHIP IN THESE ECOLOGIES. WE CONCEPTUALIZE THIS DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP AS SOCIAL MEDIA SYMBIOSIS, AN ANALOGY THAT DRAWS ON THE BIOLOGICAL CONCEPT OF SYMBIOSIS, AND THAT EXPLAINS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PERCEIVED ONLINE PERSUASION: (1) THE PRIMACY OF SOCIAL MEDIA PERSUASION OVER OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES, (2) ITS GRADUAL AND EVOLUTIONARY NATURE, AND (3) THE PERSUASIVE RELATIONSHIPS IN WHICH USERS MAY ENGAGE: MUTUALISM, IN WHICH BOTH SENDER AND RECEIVER RECIPROCALLY BENEFIT AND PERSUADE EACH OTHER; AND PARASITISM, IN WHICH FAKE NEWS CREATORS HARMFULLY PERSUADE RECEIVERS WHILE BENEFITTING.

This study contributes to this topic by examining how political attitude change in social media unfolds according to users' perceptions. Our findings, based on in-depth interviews with 30 Spanish social media users, show how the centrality of social media in citizens' everyday life nudges them into a persuasive relationship in these ecologies. We conceptualize this dynamic relationship as social media symbiosis, an analogy that draws on the biological concept of symbiosis, and that explains the characteristics of perceived online persuasion: (1) the primacy of social media persuasion over other information sources, (2) its gradual and evolutionary nature, and (3) the persuasive relationships in which users may engage: mutualism, in which both sender and receiver reciprocally benefit and persuade each other; and parasitism, in which fake news creators harmfully persuade receivers while benefitting. Our study contributes to extant literature by theorizing about the persuasive relationship in which users perceive to engage in social media, and the rationales that facilitate it.",Social media symbiosis: Understanding the dynamics of online political persuasion in social media ecologies,attitude change; political persuasion; social media; symbiosis; qualitative methods,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY;WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA;PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE);PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY;PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY -UNIVERSITY PARK;PENN STATE BEHREND;UNIVERSITY DIEGO PORTALES,CARLOS III UNIV MADRID,NA,"JORD√Å B, 2024, JOURNALISM","JORD√Å B, 2024, JOURNALISM"

While concerns often focus on potential misinformation harms, 'non-consensual intimate deepfakes' (NCID) - a form of image-based sexual abuse - pose a current, severe, and growing threat, disproportionately impacting women and girls. This article examines the measures implemented with the recently adopted Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA) and argues that the new criminal offences and the 'systems and processes' approach the law adopts are insufficient to counter NCID in the UK. This is because the OSA relies on platform policies that often lack consistency regarding synthetic media and on platforms' content removal mechanisms which offer limited redress to victimsurvivors after the harm has already occurred. The article argues that stronger prevention mechanisms are necessary and proposes that the law should mandate all AI-powered deepfake creation tools to ban the generation of intimate synthetic content and require the implementation of comprehensive and enforceable content moderation systems.",When non-consensual intimate deepfakes go viral: The insufficiency of the UK Online Safety Act,Deepfakes; Synthetic media; Image-based sexual abuse; Content moderation; AI regulation; Online Safety Act; Social media platforms; United Kingdom,UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX,UNIV SUSSEX,NA,"KIRA B, 2024, COMPUT LAW SECUR REV","KIRA B, 2024, COMPUT LAW SECUR REV"

The study highlights the complexity of detecting deepfakes, which are highly convincing video and audio forgeries created by artificial intelligence programs. These forgeries, often indistinguishable from authentic recordings, raise concerns about their impact on public opinion, elections, and national security. The paper discusses the potential consequences of deepfakes, including the erosion of trust in institutions, financial fraud, election interference, and national security threats. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, including technological solutions, responsible AI development, legislation, international cooperation, and societal awareness. Efforts to combat deepfakes involve the development of detection tools, ethical AI practices, legal regulations, and global collaboration to share information and best practices.

It is being received enthusiastically by legislative bodies and regular users of machine-learning-boosted applications alike. However, opening the black box of AI comes at a cost. This paper presents the results of the first study proving that xAI can enable successful adversarial attacks in the domain of fake news detection and lead to a decrease in AI security. We postulate the novel concept that xAI and security should strike a balance, especially in critical applications, such as fake news detection. An attack scheme against fake news detection methods is presented that employs an explainable solution. The described experiment demonstrates that the well-established SHAP explainer can be used to reshape the structure of the original message in such a way that the value of the model's prediction could be arbitrarily forced, whilst the meaning of the message stays the same. The paper presents various examples for which the SHAP values are used to point the adversary to the words and phrases that have to be changed to flip the label on the model prediction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it has been the first research work to experimentally demonstrate the sinister side of xAI. As the generation and spreading of fake news has become a tool of modern warfare and a grave threat to democracy, the potential impact of explainable AI should be addressed as soon as possible.",When explainability turns into a threat- using xAI to fool a fake news detection method,Explainable AI; Adversarial attacks; NLP; Fake news; BERT,BYDGOSZCZ UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF SALERNO;UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW,UNIV SALERNO,NA,"KOZIK R, 2024, COMPUT SECUR","KOZIK R, 2024, COMPUT SECUR"

FAKE NEWS IS CREATED BY MANIPULATING IMAGES, TEXT, AUDIO, AND VIDEOS, PARTICULARLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE PROLIFERATION OF SUCH DISINFORMATION CAN TRIGGER DETRIMENTAL SOCIETAL EFFECTS. FALSE FORWARDED MESSAGES CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON SOCIETY, SPREADING PROPAGANDA, INCITING VIOLENCE, MANIPULATING PUBLIC OPINION, AND EVEN INFLUENCING ELECTIONS. A MAJOR SHORTCOMING OF EXISTING FAKE NEWS DETECTION METHODS IS THEIR INABILITY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY LEARN AND EXTRACT FEATURES FROM TWO MODALITIES AND TRAIN MODELS WITH SHARED REPRESENTATIONS OF MULTIMODAL (TEXTUAL AND VISUAL) INFORMATION. FEATURE ENGINEERING IS A CRITICAL TASK IN THE FAKE NEWS DETECTION MODEL'S MACHINE LEARNING (ML) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. FOR ML MODELS TO BE EXPLAINABLE AND TRUSTED, FEATURE ENGINEERING SHOULD DESCRIBE HOW MANY FEATURES USED IN THE ML MODELS CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS. FEATURE ENGINEERING, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXPLAINABLE AI SYSTEM BY SHAPING THE FEATURES USED IN THE ML MODELS, IS AN INTERCONNECTED CONCEPT WITH EXPLAINABLE AI AS IT AFFECTS THE MODEL'S INTERPRETABILITY. IN THE RESEARCH, WE DEVELOP A FAKE NEWS DETECTOR MODEL IN WHICH WE (1) IDENTIFY SEVERAL TEXTUAL AND VISUAL FEATURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FAKE OR CREDIBLE NEWS; SPECIFICALLY, WE EXTRACT FEATURES FROM ARTICLE TITLES, CONTENTS, AND, TOP IMAGES; (2) INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF ALL MULTIMODAL FEATURES (CONTENT, EMOTIONS AND MANIPULATION-BASED) AND COMBINE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS USING THE FEATURE ENGINEERING THAT REPRESENT THE BEHAVIOR OF FAKE NEWS PROPAGATORS; AND (3) DEVELOP A MODEL TO DETECT DISINFORMATION ON BENCHMARK MULTIMODAL DATASETS CONSISTING OF TEXT AND IMAGES.

Fake news is created by manipulating images, text, audio, and videos, particularly on social media, and the proliferation of such disinformation can trigger detrimental societal effects. False forwarded messages can have a devastating impact on society, spreading propaganda, inciting violence, manipulating public opinion, and even influencing elections. A major shortcoming of existing fake news detection methods is their inability to simultaneously learn and extract features from two modalities and train models with shared representations of multimodal (textual and visual) information. Feature engineering is a critical task in the fake news detection model's machine learning (ML) development process. For ML models to be explainable and trusted, feature engineering should describe how many features used in the ML models contribute to making more accurate predictions. Feature engineering, which plays an important role in the development of an explainable AI system by shaping the features used in the ML models, is an interconnected concept with explainable AI as it affects the model's interpretability. In the research, we develop a fake news detector model in which we (1) identify several textual and visual features that are associated with fake or credible news; specifically, we extract features from article titles, contents, and, top images; (2) investigate the role of all multimodal features (content, emotions and manipulation-based) and combine the cumulative effects using the feature engineering that represent the behavior of fake news propagators; and (3) develop a model to detect disinformation on benchmark multimodal datasets consisting of text and images. We conduct experiments on several real-world multimodal fake news datasets, and our results show that on average, our model outperforms existing single-modality methods by large margins that do not use any feature optimization techniques.",Feature importance in the age of explainable AI: Case study of detecting fake news & misinformation via a multi-modal framework,Analytics; Feature selection; Machine learning; Explainable data analytics; Optimization algorithm,EMLYON BUSINESS SCHOOL;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,NOTDECLARED,NA,"KUMAR A, 2024, EUR J OPER RES","KUMAR A, 2024, EUR J OPER RES"

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE FEASIBILITY OF EMPLOYING CROWDSOURCING FOR THE TASK OF MISINFORMATION DETECTION HAVE PROVIDED INCONSISTENT RESULTS: SOME OF THEM SEEM TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CROWDSOURCING FOR ASSESSING THE TRUTHFULNESS OF STATEMENTS AND CLAIMS, WHEREAS OTHERS FAIL TO REACH AN EFFECTIVENESS LEVEL HIGHER THAN AUTOMATIC MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES, WHICH ARE STILL UNSATISFACTORY. IN THIS PAPER, WE AIM AT ADDRESSING SUCH INCONSISTENCY AND UNDERSTAND IF TRUTHFULNESS ASSESSMENT CAN INDEED BE CROWDSOURCED EFFECTIVELY. TO DO SO, WE BUILD ON TOP OF PREVIOUS STUDIES; WE SELECT SOME OF THOSE REPORTING LOW EFFECTIVENESS LEVELS, WE HIGHLIGHT THEIR POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS, AND WE THEN REPRODUCE THEIR WORK ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE THEIR SETUP TO ADDRESS THOSE LIMITATIONS. WE EMPLOY VARIOUS APPROACHES, DATA QUALITY LEVELS, AND AGREEMENT MEASURES TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF CROWD WORKERS WHEN ASSESSING THE TRUTHFULNESS OF (MIS)INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, WE EXPLORE DIFFERENT WORKER FEATURES AND COMPARE THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH DIFFERENT CROWDS. ACCORDING TO OUR FINDINGS, CROWDSOURCING CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE METHODOLOGY TO TACKLE MISINFORMATION AT SCALE. WHEN COMPARED TO PREVIOUS STUDIES, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN CROWD WORKERS AND EXPERTS CAN BE OBTAINED BY USING A DIFFERENT, HIGHER -QUALITY, CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM AND BY IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF THE CROWDSOURCING TASK.

Previous studies on the feasibility of employing crowdsourcing for the task of misinformation detection have provided inconsistent results: some of them seem to confirm the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for assessing the truthfulness of statements and claims, whereas others fail to reach an effectiveness level higher than automatic machine learning approaches, which are still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we aim at addressing such inconsistency and understand if truthfulness assessment can indeed be crowdsourced effectively. To do so, we build on top of previous studies; we select some of those reporting low effectiveness levels, we highlight their potential limitations, and we then reproduce their work attempting to improve their setup to address those limitations. We employ various approaches, data quality levels, and agreement measures to assess the reliability of crowd workers when assessing the truthfulness of (mis)information. Furthermore, we explore different worker features and compare the results obtained with different crowds. According to our findings, crowdsourcing can be used as an effective methodology to tackle misinformation at scale. When compared to previous studies, our results indicate that a significantly higher agreement between crowd workers and experts can be obtained by using a different, higher -quality, crowdsourcing platform and by improving the design of the crowdsourcing task. Also, we find differences concerning task and worker features and how workers provide truthfulness assessments.",Crowdsourced Fact-checking: Does It Actually Work?,Crowdsourcing; Misinformation; Truthfulness classification,UNIVERSITY OF UDINE;UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND;CENTRUM WISKUNDE AND INFORMATICA (CWI);ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (RMIT),UNIV UDINE,NA,"LA BARBERA D, 2024, INFORM PROCESS MANAG","LA BARBERA D, 2024, INFORM PROCESS MANAG"

This tactic is used to launch fake news, political propaganda, and social engineering attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to effectively trace the source of disinformation and detect content with abnormal similarities. Our approach not only analyzes the content itself but also focuses on the external uniform resource locators (URLs) associated with the content and the specific pages where the malicious content appears. The framework is designed to filter out suspicious content, external URLs, and channels based on a few verified instances of disinformation, using an adaptive approach that can quickly respond to evolving disinformation tactics. The framework was evaluated using a real dataset and revealed that certain channels on OSM platforms function as critical bridges between normal and disinformation clusters. Our study offers valuable insights for OSM platforms and administrators to proactively detect clusters of disinformation messages, external URLs, and channels with only a small number of manually verified samples. Additionally, it illuminates the role and dynamics of how disinformation evolves and spreads, which can aid in developing more effective strategies to combat disinformation on OSM platforms.",Tracking of Disinformation Sources: Examining Pages and URLs,Information integrity; Fake news; Social networking (online); Task analysis; Bridges; Voting; Blogs; Adaptively defense; disinformation website; social media; source pursuing,TUNGHAI UNIVERSITY,TUNGHAI UNIV,NA,"LAI CM, 2024, IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY","LAI CM, 2024, IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY"

The paper pays particular attention to the legal perception of disinformation in the context of deepfake technology, highlighting the harmful social and legal outcomes involved.

THE EMERGENCE AND PREVALENCE OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA STEM FROM COMMUNAL PROCESSES OF ONLINE POLITICAL DEBATE OR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS THAT DEGENERATE INTO CONSPIRACY BELIEFS. THIS STUDY VIEWS THE ONLINE FORMATION OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS A SOCIALLY EMERGENT PROCESS. SUBSCRIBING TO A SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONIST LENS AND SYNTHESIZING EXTANT LITERATURE ON SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA AFFORDANCES, WE CONDUCTED DISCOURSE ANALYSIS ON DISCURSIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM TWITTER FOR THE 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FRAUD CONSPIRACY THEORY. THROUGH THE ANALYSIS, WE DELINEATE THE FORMATION OF CONSPIRACY THEORY INTO FOUR STAGES AND CHARACTERIZE EACH STAGE ACCORDING TO ITS MOBILIZING STRUCTURE, PARTICIPANTS, MODE OF INTERACTION, CONTENT CREATED, AND DISCERNIBLE COLLECTIVE ACTION. WE ALSO IDENTIFY SOCIAL MEDIA AFFORDANCES FACILITATING THE FORMATION OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES WITHIN AND ACROSS STAGES. FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ADVANCE CONTEMPORARY KNOWLEDGE ON CONSPIRACY THEORIES BY NOT ONLY EXTENDING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN CONSPIRACY THEORY FORMATION, BUT THEY ALSO AID PRACTITIONERS IN COMPREHENDING THE FORMATION PROCESS OF CONSPIRACY THEORY FORMATION, THE LATTER OF WHICH CONSTITUTES THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVISING APPROPRIATE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES.","LI, BOYING;JI, DAVID;FU, MENGYAO;TAN, CHEE-WEE;CHONG, ALAIN;LIM, ERIC T.

The emergence and prevalence of conspiracy theories on social media stem from communal processes of online political debate or social movements that degenerate into conspiracy beliefs. This study views the online formation of conspiracy theories as a socially emergent process. Subscribing to a social constructionist lens and synthesizing extant literature on social movements and social media affordances, we conducted discourse analysis on discursive data collected from Twitter for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Fraud Conspiracy Theory. Through the analysis, we delineate the formation of conspiracy theory into four stages and characterize each stage according to its mobilizing structure, participants, mode of interaction, content created, and discernible collective action. We also identify social media affordances facilitating the formation of conspiracy theories within and across stages. Findings of this study advance contemporary knowledge on conspiracy theories by not only extending our understanding of the role of social media in conspiracy theory formation, but they also aid practitioners in comprehending the formation process of conspiracy theory formation, the latter of which constitutes the foundation for devising appropriate prevention and mitigation strategies.",Unveiling the formation of conspiracy theory on social media: A discourse analysis,Conspiracy theory; stages of formation; social movement; social media affordance; discourse analysis; Twitter,UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM NINGBO CHINA;CITY UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL;UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY;UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM NINGBO CHINA,UNIV NOTTINGHAM NINGBO CHINA,NA,"LI BY, 2024, J INF TECHNOL-UK","LI BY, 2024, J INF TECHNOL-UK"

Consequently, countries like Colombia are exploring the application of AI in political campaigns while simultaneously working on regulating its use within their democratic framework. In view of the 2023 upcoming elections, the debate surrounding the ethics and impact of AI in political communication gains significant relevance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in Colombian political communication, its influence on polarization, and its role in disseminating disinformation. By employing the Delphi method with a panel of electoral strategy experts, the findings revealed a consensus among experts regarding AI's utility in creating content for social networks and segmenting political messages. However, there was disagreement regarding its suitability for generating government plans and its influence on the perception of the candidates' image. Additionally, experts concurred that algorithmic communication exacerbates polarization on social networks but held differing opinions on whether it enhances or diminishes electoral participation.",Uses and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in electoral campaigns 2023: Delphi survey of strategic experts in Colombia,Artificial intelligence; political communication; ChatGPT; electoral processes; po- larization; disinformation,UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLA;FUDAN UNIVERSITY,UNIV SEVILLE,NA,"L√ìPEZ-PONCE M, 2024, REV ICONO 14","L√ìPEZ-PONCE M, 2024, REV ICONO 14"
x,human-centric empirical resaerch,,generative,response,perception,x,x,x,,,LUNDBERG E;MOZELIUS P,THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DEEPFAKES ON NEWS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT,"DEEPFAKES ARE SYNTHETIC MEDIA, SUCH AS PICTURES, MUSIC AND VIDEOS, CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GENAI) TOOLS, A TECHNIQUE THAT BUILDS UPON MACHINE LEARNING AND MULTI-LAYERED NEURAL NETWORKS TRAINED ON LARGE DATASETS. TODAY, ANYONE CAN CREATE DEEPFAKES ONLINE, WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE UNDERPINNING TECHNOLOGY. THIS FACT OPENS UP CREATIVE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME AS IT CREATES INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETAL CHALLENGES. SOME IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES ARE FAKE NEWS, BULLYING, DEFAMATION, MEDIA MANIPULATION AND DEMOCRACY DAMAGE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE AND DISCUSS HOW DEEPFAKES COULD AFFECT ENTERTAINMENT, EDUCATION AND DIGITAL NEWS MEDIA IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WAYS. THE CHOSEN RESEARCH STRATEGY WAS A QUALITATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY TO CREATE A SNAPSHOT OF CURRENT ATTITUDES IN BLOGS, ONLINE DISCUSSION FORA AND FROM A SELECTED EXPERT PANEL. FIRSTLY, BLOGS AND INTERNET DISCUSSION FORA ON DEEPFAKES AND AI WERE ANALYSED INDUCTIVELY. SECONDLY, RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS STEP WERE USED TO CREATE A QUESTION SCHEME FOR SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH SOME SELECTED EXPERTS THAT HAVE RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF AI AND DEEPFAKES. FINALLY, INTERVIEWS ANSWERED WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY USING THE TECHNOLOGY AFFORDANCES AND CONSTRAINTS THEORY AS AN ANALYTICAL LENS. FINDINGS SHOW THAT DEEPFAKES AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF AFFORDANCES, BUT ALSO SOME CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS TO CONSIDER. IN THE AFFORDANCE PART, THERE ARE THE POTENTIAL USE OF DEEPFAKES FOR SPECULATIVE AND PROVOKING CONCEPTS, NOT ONLY AS ENTERTAINMENT, BUT ALSO TO ILLUSTRATE EDUCATIONAL SCENARIOS THAT ARE HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TO CAPTURE IN TRADITIONAL VIDEOS, IMAGES OR SOUND RECORDINGS. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE MANY AFFORDANCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND THE CREATION OF ENVIRONMENTS WHERE REALISM IS NOT AN IMPORTANT CONDITION. SOME EXAMPLES ARE VIDEO GAME GRAPHICS, ANIMATED FILM BACKGROUND MUSIC IN GAMES AND MUSIC VIDEOS.

Today, anyone can create deepfakes online, without any knowledge about the underpinning technology. This fact opens up creative opportunities at the same time as it creates individual and societal challenges. Some identified challenges are fake news, bullying, defamation, media manipulation and democracy damage. The aim of this study was to analyse and discuss how deepfakes could affect entertainment, education and digital news media in positive and negative ways. The chosen research strategy was a qualitative cross-sectional study to create a snapshot of current attitudes in blogs, online discussion fora and from a selected expert panel. Firstly, blogs and internet discussion fora on deepfakes and AI were analysed inductively. Secondly, results from the previous step were used to create a question scheme for semi-structured interviews with some selected experts that have relevant knowledge in the field of AI and deepfakes. Finally, interviews answered were analysed thematically using the Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory as an analytical lens. Findings show that deepfakes at the same time have a wide variety of affordances, but also some critical constraints to consider. In the affordance part, there are the potential use of deepfakes for speculative and provoking concepts, not only as entertainment, but also to illustrate educational scenarios that are hard or impossible to capture in traditional videos, images or sound recordings. Furthermore, there are many affordances for entertainment and the creation of environments where realism is not an important condition. Some examples are video game graphics, animated film background music in games and music videos. However, the conclusion is that the findings comprise more of constraints than of affordances, where the serious negative aspect of deepfakes can lead to psychological, financial and social harm. Many images and videos in news media have already been manipulated during the last decades, but deepfakes can take this to a new and more problematic level where the overall trust might disappear. The author's recommendation is to further increase the focus on source criticism and that discussions on which sources to trust should be an early introduced part of educational programmes.",The potential effects of deepfakes on news media and entertainment,Deepfakes; Artificial intelligence; AI; Education; News media; Entertainment,MID-SWEDEN UNIVERSITY,MID SWEDEN UNIV,NA,"LUNDBERG E, 2025, AI SOC","LUNDBERG E, 2025, AI SOC"

However, in established democracies where access to alternative sources of information is guaranteed and educational levels are high, we witness a rise in attitudes and actions that threaten democratic foundations. Some citizens succumb to misinformation that has led them down the path of radicalization and violence; others withdraw completely from political life. How do we explain these developments? Building on democratic theory and the concepts of informational learned helplessness and selective exposure, we introduce a theoretical framework that connects digitization and digital technologies to attitudes and behaviour that threaten democracy even before democratic decay manifests. We argue that AI-assisted digital technologies expose societies to an abundance of contradictory information, limit citizens' ability to assess their trustworthiness, and reinforce the tailored dissemination of misinformation. We present the US and Germany as empirical plausibility probes that show how these features drive some citizens towards informational agnosticism, which results in de-politicization and political apathy. Others might become misbelievers who display negative attitudes towards democracy and/or engage in anti-democratic actions. Our probe offers an initial empirical illustration that provides a basis for further systematic investigations of digital technology's effects on democracy.","Information, doubt, and democracy: how digitization spurs democratic decay",Democratic decay; misinformation; digitization; USA; Germany,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MUNICH;EBERHARD KARLS UNIVERSITY OF TUBINGEN,TECH UNIV MUNICH TUM,NA,"MAATI A, 2024, DEMOCRATIZATION","MAATI A, 2024, DEMOCRATIZATION"

It does so in the context of new online safety regulation (e.g. the EU Digital Services Act) that pushes digital platforms to improve how they tackle both illegal and 'legal but harmful' content. In particular, we investigate and conceptualise X's Community Notes, a tool that uses 'human-AI cooperation' to add context to tweets, as a data infrastructure for 'soft moderation'. We find that Community Notes is limited when dealing with under-acknowledged online harms, such as those derived from the intersection between disinformation and humour. While research points to the potential of content moderation solutions that combine automation with humans-in-the-loop, we show how this approach can fail when disinformation is poorly defined in policy and practice.",The importance of centering harm in data infrastructures for 'soft moderation': X's Community Notes as a case study,Community Notes; content moderation; disinformation; DSA; esafety; fact-checking; humour; online harms; satire; Twitter,QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (QUT);QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (QUT),UNIV COLL DUBLIN,NA,"MATAMOROS-FERN√ÅNDEZ A, 2025, NEW MEDIA SOC","MATAMOROS-FERN√ÅNDEZ A, 2025, NEW MEDIA SOC"

During the last two decades, leveraging research in psychology, sociology, neuroscience and other domains, Web platforms have brought the process of capturing attention to an unprecedented scale. With the initial commonplace goal of making targeted advertising more effective, the generalization of attention-capturing techniques and their use of cognitive biases and emotions have multiple detrimental side effects such as polarizing opinions, spreading false information and threatening public health, economies and democracies. This is clearly a case where the Web is not used for the common good and where, in fact, all its users become a vulnerable population. This paper brings together contributions from a wide range of disciplines to analyze current practices and consequences thereof. Through a set of propositions and principles that could be used do drive further works, it calls for actions against these practices competing to capture our attention on the Web, as it would be unsustainable for a civilization to allow attention to be wasted with impunity on a world-wide scale.",Pay Attention: a Call to Regulate the Attention Market and Prevent Algorithmic Emotional Governance,NA,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (CNRS);UNIVERSITE COTE D'AZUR;INRIA,UNIV COTE AZUR,NA,"MICHEL F, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTH AAAI/ACM CONFERENCE ON AI, ETHICS, AND SOCIETY, AIES 2024","MICHEL F, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTH AAAI/ACM CONFERENCE ON AI, ETHICS, AND SOCIETY, AIES 2024"

COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES FROM ASIA ON THE RISKS OF AI AND MISINFORMATION FOR DEMOCRACY,"THERE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN GROWING GLOBAL CONCERNS ABOUT MISINFORMATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW DEEPFAKE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO RUN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. THESE CONCERNS, IN TURN, HAVE INFLUENCED PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF DEEPFAKES, OFTEN ASSOCIATING THEM WITH THREATS TO DEMOCRACY AND FOSTERING LESS POSITIVE VIEWS. BUT DOES HIGH TRUST IN GOVERNMENT MITIGATE THESE INFLUENCES, THEREBY STRENGTHENING POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF DEEPFAKES? IN A CROSS-NATIONAL SURVEY CONDUCTED IN MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE, AND INDIA, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION EITHER BETWEEN CONCERN ABOUT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION ONLINE OR PERCEIVED RISKS OF AI TO DEMOCRACY, WITH POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS DEEPFAKES. HOWEVER, WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR THE MODERATING FACTOR OF TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, RESPONDENTS IN SINGAPORE WHO HAVE HIGH TRUST LEVELS EXHIBITED MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS DEEPFAKES, DESPITE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT MISINFORMATION. SIMILARLY, HIGHER TRUST IN GOVERNMENT CORRELATED WITH MORE FAVORABLE PERCEPTIONS OF DEEPFAKES EVEN AMONG THOSE WHO VIEW AI AS A RISK TO DEMOCRACY; THIS EFFECT IS EVIDENT ACROSS ALL THREE COUNTRIES.

These concerns, in turn, have influenced people's perceptions of deepfakes, often associating them with threats to democracy and fostering less positive views. But does high trust in government mitigate these influences, thereby strengthening positive perceptions of deepfakes? In a cross-national survey conducted in Malaysia, Singapore, and India, we found no evidence of a negative association either between concern about the spread of misinformation online or perceived risks of AI to democracy, with positive attitudes towards deepfakes. However, when accounting for the moderating factor of trust in government, respondents in Singapore who have high trust levels exhibited more positive attitudes towards deepfakes, despite their concerns about misinformation. Similarly, higher trust in government correlated with more favorable perceptions of deepfakes even among those who view AI as a risk to democracy; this effect is evident across all three countries. In the conclusion, we spell out the implications of these findings for politics in Asia and beyond.",Does trust in government moderate the perception towards deepfakes?

Left unchecked, AI will exacerbate already substantial existing challenges, such as racial polarization, cultural anxiety, antidemocratic attitudes, racial vote dilution, and voter suppression. Synthetic video and audio (""deepfakes"") receive the bulk of popular attention-but are just the tip of the iceberg. Microtargeting of racially tailored disinformation, racial bias in automated election administration, racially targeted cyberattacks, and AI-powered surveillance that chills racial justice claims are just a few examples of how AI is threatening democracy. Unfortunately, existing laws- including the Voting Rights Act-are unlikely to address the challenges. These problems, however, are not insurmountable if policymakers, activists, and technology companies act now. This Article asserts that AI should be regulated to facilitate a racially inclusive democracy, proposes novel principles that provide a framework to regulate AI, and offers specific policy interventions to illustrate the implementation of the principles. Even though race is the most significant demographic factor that shapes voting patterns in the United States, this is the first article to comprehensively identify the racial harms to democracy posed by AI and offer a way forward.",Overcoming Racial Harms to Democracy from Artificial Intelligence,NA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIV;GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIV,NA,"OVERTON S, 2025, IOWA LAW REV","OVERTON S, 2025, IOWA LAW REV"

IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMATION WARFARE AND THE CAPABILITIES OF GENERATIVE AI, FNPDS HAVE PROLIFERATED. THEY HAVE BECOME A POWERFUL AND QUITE EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR INFLUENCING PEOPLE'S SOCIAL IDENTITIES, ATTITUDES, OPINIONS AND EVEN BEHAVIOR. AD HOC MALICIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND ORGANIZED NETWORKS OF TROLLS AND BOTS TARGET COUNTRIES, SOCIETIES, SOCIAL GROUPS, POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND INDIVIDUALS. AS A RESULT, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, ECHO CHAMBERS, FILTER BUBBLES AND OTHER PROCESSES OF FRAGMENTATION AND MARGINALIZATION ARE POLARIZING, RADICALIZING, AND DISINTEGRATING SOCIETY IN TERMS OF COHERENT POLITICS, GOVERNANCE, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS OF TRUST AND COOPERATION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EXPLORE ADVANCES IN USING MACHINE AND DEEP LEARNING TO DETECT FNPD IN OSNS EFFECTIVELY. WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A COMBINED PRISMA (PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES) REVIEW IN THREE ANALYSIS DOMAINS: 1) PROPAGATORS (AUTHORS, TROLLS, AND BOTS), 2) TEXTUAL CONTENT, 3) SOCIAL IMPACT. THIS SYSTEMIC RESEARCH FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES META-ANALYSES OF THREE RESEARCH DOMAINS, PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE WIDER RESEARCH FIELD AND REVEALING IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE RESEARCH DOMAINS. IT NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE MOST PROMISING ML/DL RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES AND HYBRID APPROACHES IN EACH DOMAIN, BUT ALSO PROVIDES PERSPECTIVES AND INSIGHTS ON FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS.","PLIKYNAS, DARIUS;RIZGELIENE, IEVA;KORVEL, GRAZINA","ABBAS AM, 2021, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V11, DOI 10.1007/S13278-021-00799-Z;ABUALIGAH L, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V14, DOI 10.1007/S13278-024-01198-W;AHMAD I, 2020, COMPLEXITY, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/8885861;AHMED S., 2022, ARXIV;AHSAN MOHAMMAD, 2019, ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MEDIA, V14, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.OSNEM.2019.100050;A√èMEUR E, 2023, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V13, DOI 10.1007/S13278-023-01028-5;AJIR M., 2018, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY, V12, P70;AL ATIQI M, 2020, JOINT INT CONF SOFT, P199, DOI 10.1109/SCISISIS50064.2020.9322696;AL ATIQI M, 2018, JOINT INT CONF SOFT, P1301, DOI 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2018.00204;AL-TAI M.

In the context of information warfare and the capabilities of generative AI, FNPDs have proliferated. They have become a powerful and quite effective tool for influencing people's social identities, attitudes, opinions and even behavior. Ad hoc malicious social media accounts and organized networks of trolls and bots target countries, societies, social groups, political campaigns and individuals. As a result, conspiracy theories, echo chambers, filter bubbles and other processes of fragmentation and marginalization are polarizing, radicalizing, and disintegrating society in terms of coherent politics, governance, and social networks of trust and cooperation. This systematic review aims to explore advances in using machine and deep learning to detect FNPD in OSNs effectively. We present the results of a combined PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review in three analysis domains: 1) propagators (authors, trolls, and bots), 2) textual content, 3) social impact. This systemic research framework integrates meta-analyses of three research domains, providing an overview of the wider research field and revealing important relationships between these research domains. It not only addresses the most promising ML/DL research methodologies and hybrid approaches in each domain, but also provides perspectives and insights on future research directions.","Systematic Review of Fake News, Propaganda, and Disinformation: Examining Authors, Content, and Social Impact Through Machine Learning",Fake news; Social networking (online); Systematic literature review; Feature extraction; Content management; Classification algorithms; Analytical models; Accuracy; Security; Machine learning; deep learning; propaganda and disinformation; fake news; PRISMA systematic review; authors' analysis; content analysis; social impact analysis; social impact analysis,VILNIUS UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;VILNIUS UNIV,NA,"PLIKYNAS D, 2025, IEEE ACCESS","PLIKYNAS D, 2025, IEEE ACCESS"

In this paper, we analyze the Twitter traffic related to the US 2020 pre-election debate and ask whether it mirrors the electoral system. The U.S. electoral system provides that, regardless of the actual vote gap, the premier candidate who received more votes in one state 'takes' that state. Criticisms of this system have pointed out that election campaigns can be more intense in particular key states to achieve victory, so-called swing states. Our intuition is that election debate may cause more traffic on Twitter-and probably be more plagued by misinformation-when associated with swing states. The results mostly confirm the intuition. About 88% of the entire traffic can be associated with swing states, and links to non-trustworthy news are shared far more in swing-related traffic than the same type of news in safe-related traffic. Considering traffic origin instead, non-trustworthy tweets generated by automated accounts, so-called social bots, are mostly associated with swing states.

However, maps are increasingly being wielded to spread misinformation due to the democratization of mapmaking, advances in AI, and the emergence of post-truth politics. Trust plays a fundamental role in the spread of misinformation, but our understanding of trust in the context of maps is limited. In this paper, I examine the methodologies employed by empirical studies on trust in maps and synthesize the major findings of said studies. Most of the reviewed studies were experiments that utilized single-item self-reporting Likert-type measures to capture trust. I organized the findings of the studies into six major themes including source, metadata, transparency, uncertainty, design, and information modality. Additionally, I present a research agenda based on the findings and limitations of existing works. This agenda highlights methodological challenges to studying trust in maps and proposes opportunities in the form of research questions.",Trust in maps: what we know and what we need to know,Trust; cartographic design; ethics; persuasion; misinformation; methods,PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE);PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY;PENN STATE BEHREND;PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY - UNIVERSITY PARK,PENN STATE UNIV,NA,"PRESTBY TJ, 2025, CARTOGR GEOGR INF SC","PRESTBY TJ, 2025, CARTOGR GEOGR INF SC"

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF BERT-LIKE ENCODER-ONLY MODELS AND AUTOREGRESSIVE DECODER-ONLY LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS) FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION. WE INTRODUCE A DATASET OF NEWS ARTICLES LABELED WITH GPT-4 ASSISTANCE (AN AI-LABELING METHOD) AND VERIFIED BY HUMAN EXPERTS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY. BOTH BERT-LIKE ENCODER-ONLY MODELS AND LLMS WERE FINE-TUNED ON THIS DATASET. ADDITIONALLY, WE DEVELOPED AN INSTRUCTION-TUNED LLM APPROACH WITH MAJORITY VOTING DURING INFERENCE FOR LABEL GENERATION. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT BERT-LIKE MODELS GENERALLY OUTPERFORM LLMS IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS, WHILE LLMS DEMONSTRATE SUPERIOR ROBUSTNESS AGAINST TEXT PERTURBATIONS. COMPARED TO WEAK LABELS (DISTANT SUPERVISION) DATA, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AI LABELS WITH HUMAN SUPERVISION ACHIEVE BETTER CLASSIFICATION RESULTS.

This study presents a comparative evaluation of BERT-like encoder-only models and autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) for fake news detection. We introduce a dataset of news articles labeled with GPT-4 assistance (an AI-labeling method) and verified by human experts to ensure reliability. Both BERT-like encoder-only models and LLMs were fine-tuned on this dataset. Additionally, we developed an instruction-tuned LLM approach with majority voting during inference for label generation. Our analysis reveals that BERT-like models generally outperform LLMs in classification tasks, while LLMs demonstrate superior robustness against text perturbations. Compared to weak labels (distant supervision) data, the results show that AI labels with human supervision achieve better classification results. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining AI-based annotation with human oversight and demonstrates the performance of different families of machine learning models for fake news detection.",Fake news detection: comparative evaluation of BERT-like models and large language models with generative AI-annotated data,Fake news; Large language models; BERT models; Annotations,TORONTO METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY,COLL ST,NA,"RAZA S, 2025, KNOWL INF SYST","RAZA S, 2025, KNOWL INF SYST"

In the field of journalism, news media have also portrayed AI. However, little attention has been paid to the symbiosis between AI and political disinformation. This study explores how journalistic discourses address the relationship between AI, disinformation and politics, delving into the concepts or technologies applied. Drawing upon content analysis and framing theory, we analyze the contents of political disinformation published by five newspapers from different European countries: Tagesspiegel, The Guardian, Le Figaro, Corriere della Sera, and El Pa & iacute;s. Specifically, all the news items on these topics published in 2023 are examined by using a keyword search. Results show a relatively fragmented presence of frames, but the approach is slightly more likely to be negative.

HOWEVER, THE RAPID PROLIFERATION OF ONLINE MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OUTPACES THE ABILITY OF FACT-CHECKERS TO DEBUNK FALSE CLAIMS. AUTOMATED DETECTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE MISINFORMATION OFFERS A PROMISING SOLUTION. IN THIS STUDY, WE ADDRESS THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING A TWO-STEP HIERARCHICAL MODEL. THE AUGMENTED COMPUTER ASSISTED RECOGNITION OF DENIAL AND SKEPTICISM (CARDS) MODEL IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR CATEGORISING CLIMATE CLAIMS ON TWITTER. FURTHERMORE, WE APPLY THE AUGMENTED CARDS MODEL TO FIVE MILLION CLIMATE-THEMED TWEETS OVER A SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN 2022. WE FIND THAT OVER HALF OF CONTRARIAN CLIMATE CLAIMS ON TWITTER INVOLVE ATTACKS ON CLIMATE ACTORS.

However, the rapid proliferation of online misinformation on social media platforms outpaces the ability of fact-checkers to debunk false claims. Automated detection of climate change misinformation offers a promising solution. In this study, we address this gap by developing a two-step hierarchical model. The Augmented Computer Assisted Recognition of Denial and Skepticism (CARDS) model is specifically designed for categorising climate claims on Twitter. Furthermore, we apply the Augmented CARDS model to five million climate-themed tweets over a six-month period in 2022. We find that over half of contrarian climate claims on Twitter involve attacks on climate actors. Spikes in climate contrarianism coincide with one of four stimuli: political events, natural events, contrarian influencers, or convinced influencers. Implications for automated responses to climate misinformation are discussed. An analysis of five million climate-themed social-media posts identified four distinct spikes in climate change misinformation, using a two-step hierarchical model in machine learning.",Hierarchical machine learning models can identify stimuli of climate change misinformation on social media,NA,MONASH UNIVERSITY;MONASH UNIVERSITY;MONASH UNIVERSITY;MONASH UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF EXETER;UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE,MONASH UNIV;MONASH UNIV;UNIV MELBOURNE,NA,"ROJAS C, 2024, COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON","ROJAS C, 2024, COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON"

In this study, the effectiveness is investigated of advanced machine learning models-convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs)-for robust fake news classification. Each model brings unique strengths to the task, from CNNs' pattern recognition capabilities to BERT and GPTs' contextual understanding in the embedding space. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned GPT-4 Omni models achieve 98.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional models like CNNs, which achieved only 58.6%. Notably, the smaller GPT-4o mini model performed comparably to its larger counterpart, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of smaller models for specialized tasks. These findings emphasize the importance of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to optimize the performance for complex tasks such as fake news classifier development, where capturing subtle contextual relationships in text is crucial. However, challenges such as computational costs and suboptimal outcomes in zero-shot classification persist, particularly when distinguishing fake content from legitimate information. By highlighting the practical application of fine-tuned LLMs and exploring the potential of few-shot learning for fake news detection, this research provides valuable insights for news organizations seeking to implement scalable and accurate solutions. Ultimately, this work contributes to fostering transparency and integrity in journalism through innovative AI-driven methods for fake news classification and automated fake news classifier systems.","Fake News Detection and Classification: A Comparative Study of Convolutional Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and Natural Language Processing Models",fake news classification; fake news detection; fake news classifier; misinformation; disinformation; convolutional neural networks (CNNs); bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT); generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs); natural language processing (NLP); information integrity,UNIVERSITY OF PELOPONNESE;AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS,NOTREPORTED;UNIV PELOPONNESE,NA,"ROUMELIOTIS KI, 2025, FUTURE INTERNET","ROUMELIOTIS KI, 2025, FUTURE INTERNET"

Previous research has shown how social correction can be an effective way to curb misinformation, by engaging directly in a constructive dialogue with users who spread - often in good faith - misleading messages. Although professional fact-checkers are crucial to debunking viral claims, they usually do not engage in conversations on social media. Thereby, significant effort has been made to automate the use of fact-checker material in social correction; however, no previous work has tried to integrate it with the style and pragmatics that are commonly employed in social media communication. To fill this gap, we present VerMouth, the first large-scale dataset comprising roughly 12 thousand claim-response pairs (linked to debunking articles), accounting for both SMP-style and basic emotions, two factors which have a significant role in misinformation credibility and spreading. To collect this dataset we used a technique based on an author-reviewer pipeline, which efficiently combines LLMs and human annotators to obtain high-quality data. We also provide comprehensive experiments showing how models trained on our proposed dataset have significant improvements in terms of output quality and generalization capabilities.",Countering Misinformation via Emotional Response Generation,NA,FONDAZIONE BRUNO KESSLER;UNIVERSITY OF TRENTO,D (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);UNIV TRENTO,NA,"RUSSO D, 2023, 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)","RUSSO D, 2023, 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)"

However, the deliberate and non-deliberate spreading of misinformation and fake news severely damages the cohesion of our societies. This effect is intensified by the ease and speed of information creation and distribution that today's social media offers. In addition, the current state-of-the-art for artificial intelligence available to everybody at their fingertips to create ultra-realistic fake multimedia news is unprecedented. This situation challenges professionals within the communication sphere, i.e., media professionals and public servants, to counter this flood of misinformation. While these professionals can also use artificial intelligence to combat fake news, introducing this technology into the working environment and work processes often meets a wide variety of resistance. Hence, this paper investigates what barriers but also chances these communication experts identify from their professional point of view. For this purpose, we have conducted a quantitative study with more than 100 participants, including journalists, press officers, experts from different ministries, and scientists. We analyzed the results with a particular focus on the types of fake news and in which capacity they were encountered, the experts' general attitude towards artificial intelligence, as well as the perceived most pressing barriers concerning its use. The results are then discussed, and propositions are made concerning actions for the most pressing issues with a broad societal impact.",Barriers to the Introduction of Artificial Intelligence to Support Communication Experts in Media and the Public Sector to Combat Fake News and Misinformation,Fake News; Artificial Intelligence; Media Forensic; Journalism; Social Media; Public Sector,UNIV CONTINUING EDUC KREMS,UNIV CONTINUING EDUC KREMS,NA,"SEB√ñCK W, 2023, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","SEB√ñCK W, 2023, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC"

WE RELIED ON STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP LEARNING ANALYSIS (A BRANCH OF ARTICIFIAL INTELLIGENCE) TO INVESTIGATE ALL COVID-19-RELATED ARTICLES (N = 72,339) PUBLISHED ON THREE MAJOR HUNGARIAN NEWS PORTALS BETWEEN MARCH 2020 AND MARCH 2022. WE USED A NEW FINE-TUNED BERT MODEL FOR EMOTION ANALYSIS, THE CATEGORIES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED INTO THREE SENTIMENT LABELS (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, AND NEUTRAL). OUR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SENTENCES MENTIONING AT LEAST ONE OF THE VACCINES AND THE (FIRST) SHOTS ADMINISTERED FOR ONLY ONE OUTLET OUT OF THREE. THE PRO-GOVERNMENT PORTAL IN THE SAMPLE SHOWED MORE POSITIVITY TOWARDS WESTERN VACCINES THAN A HARD-RIGHT, ANTI-GOVERNMENT ONE. THIS LATTER ALSO PRODUCED MORE POSITIVE REPORTS CONCERNING THE RUSSIAN VACCINE. THESE RESULTS SHED LIGHT ON THE COMPLEX GEOPOLITICS OF VACCINE NARRATIVES IN HUNGARIAN MEDIA.

However, domestic politics and geopolitics may also impact the saliency, distribution, and sentiment of coverage in different outlets. Under Viktor Orb & aacute;n's illiberal leadership, Hungary sought deals for ventilators and vaccines from China and Russia-a deviation from joint European procurements. In this article, we conduct a content analysis of pro-government and Orb & aacute;n-critical media to examine differences in their treatment of Eastern and Western vaccines. We relied on state-of-the-art deep learning analysis (a branch of articifial intelligence) to investigate all COVID-19-related articles (N = 72,339) published on three major Hungarian news portals between March 2020 and March 2022. We used a new fine-tuned BERT model for emotion analysis, the categories of which have been aggregated into three sentiment labels (positive, negative, and neutral). Our sentiment analysis results show a positive correlation between the number of sentences mentioning at least one of the vaccines and the (first) shots administered for only one outlet out of three. The pro-government portal in the sample showed more positivity towards Western vaccines than a hard-right, anti-government one. This latter also produced more positive reports concerning the Russian vaccine. These results shed light on the complex geopolitics of vaccine narratives in Hungarian media. Our research contributes not only to our understanding of illiberal media systems but also by sharing a new public dataset and a fine-tuned large language model that is applicable to alternative research questions and designs.",The geopolitics of vaccine media representation in Orb√°n's Hungary-an AI-supported sentiment analysis,COVID-19; Media representation; Geopolitics; Sentiment analysis; Emotion analysis; Large language models,HUN-REN;HUN-REN CENTRE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES,HUN REN CTR SOCIAL SCI,NA,"SEBOK M, 2024, J COMPUT SOC SCI","SEBOK M, 2024, J COMPUT SOC SCI"

DRAWING INSIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE EMPATH LIBRARY'S USE IN SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA) PREDICTION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITIZEN QUESTION-ANSWER SYSTEM (CQAS), WE REDESIGNED THE PILOT SYSTEM, ACQAR. ACQAR INTEGRATES THE OUTPUTS FROM EMPATH X SLA PREDICTOR AND CQAS AS ESSENTIAL INPUTS TO THE CHATGPT ENGINE, CREATING CONTEXTUALLY AWARE RESPONSES FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICERS TO USE AS RESPONSES TO THE CITIZENS. EMPATH X SLA PREDICTOR ANTICIPATES THE EXPECTED SERVICE RESPONSE TIME BASED ON CITIZENS' EMOTIONAL STATES, WHILE CQAS RECOMMENDS ANSWERS FOR FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT OFFICER RESPONSES. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT FOR GOVERNMENTS AIMING TO ENHANCE CITIZEN SERVICE DELIVERY BY FUSING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SLA PREDICTION, QUESTION-ANSWER MODELS, AND CHATGPT. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM DESIGN AIMS TO REVOLUTIONIZE GOVERNMENT-CITIZEN INTERACTIONS, DELIVERING EMPATHETIC, EFFICIENT, AND TAILORED RESPONSES WITHOUT VIOLATING SLAS. ALTHOUGH THE FULL-SCALE DEPLOYMENT OF ACQAR IS PENDING, THIS PAPER OUTLINES A FOUNDATIONAL STEP TOWARDS THE PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM BY SHARING THE TRIAL OUTCOMES OF ACQAR.

Drawing insights from previous studies on the Empath library's use in Service Level Agreement (SLA) prediction and the implementation of the Citizen Question-Answer system (CQAS), we redesigned the pilot system, ACQAR. ACQAR integrates the outputs from Empath X SLA predictor and CQAS as essential inputs to the ChatGPT engine, creating contextually aware responses for customer service officers to use as responses to the citizens. Empath X SLA predictor anticipates the expected service response time based on citizens' emotional states, while CQAS recommends answers for faster and more efficient officer responses. This paper provides a comprehensive blueprint for governments aiming to enhance citizen service delivery by fusing sentiment analysis, SLA prediction, question-answer models, and ChatGPT. The proposed system design aims to revolutionize government-citizen interactions, delivering empathetic, efficient, and tailored responses without violating SLAs. Although the full-scale deployment of ACQAR is pending, this paper outlines a foundational step towards the practical development and implementation of an intelligent system by sharing the trial outcomes of ACQAR. By leveraging ChatGPT, this system holds the potential to significantly enhance citizen satisfaction, foster trust in government services, and strengthen overall government-citizen relationships. Additionally, the paper addresses inherent challenges associated with ChatGPT, including data opacity, potential misinformation, and occasional errors, especially critical in government decision-making. Upholding public administration's core values of transparency and accountability, the paper emphasizes the importance of AI explainability in ChatGPT's adoption within government agencies. Strategies proposed include prompt engineering, data governance, and the adoption of interpretability tools such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to enhance understanding and align ChatGPT's decision-making processes with these principles.",Enhancing Government Service Delivery: A Case Study of ACQAR Implementation and Lessons Learned from ChatGPT Integration in a Singapore Government Agency,Question Answering; Service Innovation; Citizen Services; Information Retrieval; Text Analytics,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIV,NA,"SHAN ALH, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL GOVERNMENT RESEARCH, DGO 2024","SHAN ALH, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL GOVERNMENT RESEARCH, DGO 2024"

DEEPFAKES HAVE RECENTLY BECOME COMMONPLACE IN POLITICS, POSING SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRATIC INTEGRITY. THE ADVANCEMENT OF AI-ENABLED TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING HAS MADE CREATING SYNTHETIC VIDEOS RELATIVELY EASY. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE ROLE OF POLITICAL BRAND HATE AND INDIVIDUAL MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN INFLUENCING ELECTORATES' INTENTION TO SHARE POLITICAL DEEPFAKE CONTENT.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE STUDY CREATES AND USES A FICTIONAL DEEPFAKE VIDEO TO TEST THE PROPOSED MODEL. DATA ARE COLLECTED FROM N = 310 RESPONDENTS IN INDIA AND TESTED USING PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE-STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) WITH SMARTPLS V3.FINDINGSTHE FINDINGS SUPPORT THAT IDEOLOGICAL INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE POLITICAL PARTY LEADS TO POLITICAL BRAND HATE, POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE ELECTORATES' INTENTION TO SHARE POLITICAL DEEPFAKE VIDEOS. THIS EFFECT IS PARTIALLY MEDIATED BY USERS' REDUCED INTENTION TO VERIFY POLITICAL DEEPFAKE VIDEOS. IN ADDITION, IT IS OBSERVED THAT INDIVIDUAL MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS POSITIVELY MODERATES THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL BRAND HATE ON THE INTENTION TO SHARE POLITICAL DEEPFAKE VIDEOS. INTENTION TO SHARE POLITICAL DEEPFAKE VIDEOS THUS BECOMES A MOTIVE TO SEEK REVENGE ON THE HATED PARTY, AN EXPRESSION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDEOLOGICAL HATE AND A MEANS TO PRESERVE ONE'S MORAL SELF-CONCEPT AND STRENGTHEN THEIR IDEOLOGIES AND MORAL BELIEFS.ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE STUDY EXPANDS THE GROWING DISCUSSION ABOUT DISSEMINATING POLITICAL DEEPFAKE VIDEOS USING THE THEORETICAL LENS OF THE NEGATIVE CONSUMER-BRAND RELATIONSHIP. IT VALIDATES THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL BRAND HATE ON IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR THAT IS INTENDED TO CAUSE HARM TO THE HATED PARTY. FURTHER, IT PROVIDES A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE THAT INDIVIDUAL MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS MAY FUEL THE HATERS' DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN ANTI-BRANDING BEHAVIOR. POLITICAL IDEOLOGICAL INCOMPATIBILITY REFLECTS ETHICAL REASONS FOR BRAND HATE. THEREFORE, HATE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS SERVES TO PRESERVE THEIR MORAL SELF.","SHARMA, ISHA;JAIN, KOKIL;BEHL, ABHISHEK;BAABDULLAH, ABDULLAH;GIANNAKIS, MIHALIS;DWIVEDI,

Deepfakes have recently become commonplace in politics, posing serious challenges to democratic integrity. The advancement of AI-enabled technology and machine learning has made creating synthetic videos relatively easy. This study explores the role of political brand hate and individual moral consciousness in influencing electorates' intention to share political deepfake content.Design/methodology/approachThe study creates and uses a fictional deepfake video to test the proposed model. Data are collected from N = 310 respondents in India and tested using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS v3.FindingsThe findings support that ideological incompatibility with the political party leads to political brand hate, positively affecting the electorates' intention to share political deepfake videos. This effect is partially mediated by users' reduced intention to verify political deepfake videos. In addition, it is observed that individual moral consciousness positively moderates the effect of political brand hate on the intention to share political deepfake videos. Intention to share political deepfake videos thus becomes a motive to seek revenge on the hated party, an expression of an individual's ideological hate and a means to preserve one's moral self-concept and strengthen their ideologies and moral beliefs.Originality/valueThe study expands the growing discussion about disseminating political deepfake videos using the theoretical lens of the negative consumer-brand relationship. It validates the effect of political brand hate on irrational behavior that is intended to cause harm to the hated party. Further, it provides a novel perspective that individual moral consciousness may fuel the haters' desire to engage in anti-branding behavior. Political ideological incompatibility reflects ethical reasons for brand hate. Therefore, hate among individuals with high moral consciousness serves to preserve their moral self.",Examining the motivations of sharing political deepfake videos: the role of political brand hate and moral consciousness,Deepfake; Political brand hate; Moral consciousness; Political ideological incompatibility; Fake news,YORK UNIVERSITY - CANADA;MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE (MDI);KING ABDULAZIZ UNIVERSITY;AUDENCIA;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY;SYMBIOSIS INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY;SYMBIOSIS INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT (SIBM) PUNE,SWANSEA UNIV;SYMBIOSIS INT UNIV,NA,"SHARMA I, 2023, INTERNET RES","SHARMA I, 2023, INTERNET RES"

DEEPFAKE DETECTORS EVOLVE AT THE SAME PACE AS DEEPFAKE GENERATORS, OR EVEN SLOWER, AND MORE THAN THAT, THEY ARE TRAINED ON A LIMITED AMOUNT OF DATA AND DO NOT ACHIEVE GENERALIZATION IN MOST SITUATIONS. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE ASSOCIATED WITH TRAINING DEEPFAKES LIES IN THE NECESSITY FOR A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DIVERSE GENERATED SAMPLES ORIGINATING FROM A MULTITUDE OF DISTINCT MODELS - AN ACHIEVEMENT NOT EASILY ATTAINED. FOR THAT REASON, THIS WORK AIMS TO LEVERAGE THE ONE ABUNDANT RESOURCE AT OUR DISPOSAL: REAL VIDEOS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL TRAINING FRAMEWORK FOR DEEPFAKE DETECTORS, AIMED TO IMPROVE GENERALIZATION BY CONTINUOUSLY USING ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS TO GENERATE NEW DEEPFAKES THAT A DETECTOR MIGHT NOT BE TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE, STARTING FROM REAL SAMPLES. WE AIM TO DO THAT WHILE KEEPING THE GENERATED SAMPLES AS REALISTIC AS POSSIBLE.

Deepfake detectors evolve at the same pace as deepfake generators, or even slower, and more than that, they are trained on a limited amount of data and do not achieve generalization in most situations. The primary challenge associated with training deepfakes lies in the necessity for a substantial number of diverse generated samples originating from a multitude of distinct models - an achievement not easily attained. For that reason, this work aims to leverage the one abundant resource at our disposal: real videos. This paper presents a novel training framework for deepfake detectors, aimed to improve generalization by continuously using adversarial attacks to generate new deepfakes that a detector might not be trained to recognize, starting from real samples. We aim to do that while keeping the generated samples as realistic as possible. We train the deepfake detector on the newly generated deepfakes, along with the original images, aiming to enhance its ability to differentiate between them. We show that this training method improved generalization to unseen datasets, while not using new data. More than that, this unsupervised method only uses real images, making it an easy to implement and adaptable way to improve generalization.",Improving Generalization in Deepfake Detection via Augmentation with Recurrent Adversarial Attacks,deepfake; digital video forensics; face manipulation; generalization; autoencoder; GAN; adversarial attack; data augmentation,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLITEHNICA BUCHAREST,POLITEHN BUCHAREST NATL UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NA,"STANCIU DC, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD ACM INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MULTIMEDIA AI AGAINST DISINFORMATION, MAD 2024","STANCIU DC, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD ACM INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MULTIMEDIA AI AGAINST DISINFORMATION, MAD 2024"

Prior literature explored the relationship between online activity and emotional state, cognitive resources, sunlight and weather. However, a limited understanding exists regarding the role of time of day in content spread and the impact of user activity patterns on susceptibility to mis- and disinformation. This work uncovers a strong correlation between user activity time patterns and the tendency to spread potentially disinformative content. Through quantitative analysis of Twitter (now X) data, we examine how user activity throughout the day aligns with diurnal behavioural archetypes. Evening types exhibit a significantly higher inclination towards spreading potentially disinformative content, which is more likely at night-time. This knowledge can become crucial for developing targeted interventions and strategies that mitigate misinformation spread by addressing vulnerable periods and user groups more susceptible to manipulation.",Early morning hour and evening usage habits increase misinformation-spread,Human behaviour; Misinformation spread; Diurnal patterns; Social media; Computational social science,SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTES OF TECHNOLOGY DOMAIN;ETH ZURICH;FONDAZIONE BRUNO KESSLER,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,NA,"STOCKINGER E, 2024, SCI REP-UK","STOCKINGER E, 2024, SCI REP-UK"

The majority of approaches for event classification rely on large sets of labeled training data. However, image labels for fine-grained event instances (e.g., 2016 Summer Olympics) can be sparse, incorrect, ambiguous, etc. A few approaches have addressed the lack of labeled data for event classification but cover only few events. Moreover, vision-language models that allow for zero-shot and few-shot classification with prompting have not yet been extensively exploited. In this paper, we propose four different techniques to create hard prompts including knowledge graph information from Wikidata and Wikipedia as well as an ensemble approach for zero-shot event classification. We also integrate prompt learning for state-of-the-art vision-language models to address few-shot event classification. Experimental results on six benchmarks including a new dataset comprising event instances from various domains, such as politics and natural disasters, show that our proposed approaches require much fewer training images than supervised baselines and the state-of-the-art while achieving better results.",Few-Shot Event Classification in Images using Knowledge Graphs for Prompting,NA,LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITY HANNOVER,TIB LEIBNIZ INFORMAT CTR SCI AND TECHNOL,NA,"TAHMASEBZADEH G, 2024, IEEE WINT CONF APPL","TAHMASEBZADEH G, 2024, IEEE WINT CONF APPL"

IN THIS GAME, A PLAYER BECOMES A CITIZEN FACT-CHECKER, RESPONDING TO 'NEWS ALERTS' PRINTED OUT BY THE GAME INTERFACE. THE PLAYER INVESTIGATES VARIOUS ACTORS AND EVIDENCE BY INSERTING CARTRIDGE COMBINATIONS INTO THE GAME INTERFACE.

To cultivate these skills in young learners, we have developed 'A Mystery for You' - an educational game powered by a large language model (LLM) and a tangible interface. In this game, a player becomes a citizen fact-checker, responding to 'news alerts' printed out by the game interface. The player investigates various actors and evidence by inserting cartridge combinations into the game interface. Each move the player makes results in the generation and printing of a follow-up 'news update,' which they must use to make an informed verdict about the truth or falsehood of the news. This interactive process sharpens critical thinking skills and enhances familiarity with generative AI's misinformation capacities.

SUCH ATTEMPTS REQUIRE NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS TO ACT IN COORDINATION TO EXERT INFLUENCE. YET, THE WAYS IN WHICH COORDINATED BEHAVIOR SURFACES DURING MAJOR ONLINE POLITICAL DEBATES IS STILL LARGELY UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON COORDINATED BEHAVIORS THAT TOOK PLACE ON TWITTER (NOW X) DURING THE 2020 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. UTILIZING STATE-OF-THE-ART NETWORK SCIENCE METHODS, WE DETECT AND CHARACTERIZE THE COORDINATED COMMUNITIES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE DEBATE. OUR APPROACH GOES BEYOND PREVIOUS ANALYSES BY PROPOSING A MULTIFACETED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE COORDINATED COMMUNITIES THAT ALLOWS OBTAINING NUANCED RESULTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE UNCOVER THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF COORDINATED USERS: (I) MODERATE GROUPS GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE ELECTORAL DEBATE, (II) CONSPIRATORIAL GROUPS THAT SPREAD FALSE INFORMATION AND DIVISIVE NARRATIVES, AND (III) FOREIGN INFLUENCE NETWORKS THAT EITHER SOUGHT TO TAMPER WITH THE DEBATE OR THAT EXPLOITED IT TO PUBLICIZE THEIR OWN AGENDAS. WE ALSO REVEAL A LARGE USE OF AUTOMATION BY FAR-RIGHT FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND CONSPIRATORIAL COMMUNITIES. CONVERSELY, LEFT-LEANING SUPPORTERS WERE OVERALL LESS COORDINATED AND ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN HARMLESS, FACTUAL COMMUNICATION. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT TWITTER WAS EFFECTIVE AT THWARTING THE ACTIVITY OF SOME COORDINATED GROUPS, WHILE IT FAILED ON SOME OTHER EQUALLY SUSPICIOUS ONES. OVERALL, THIS STUDY ADVANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF ONLINE HUMAN INTERACTIONS AND CONTRIBUTES NEW KNOWLEDGE TO MITIGATE CYBER SOCIAL THREATS.","TARDELLI, SERENA;NIZZOLI, LEONARDO;AVVENUTI, MARCO;CRESCI,

Such attempts require numerous accounts to act in coordination to exert influence. Yet, the ways in which coordinated behavior surfaces during major online political debates is still largely unclear. This study sheds light on coordinated behaviors that took place on Twitter (now X) during the 2020 US Presidential Election. Utilizing state-of-the-art network science methods, we detect and characterize the coordinated communities that participated in the debate. Our approach goes beyond previous analyses by proposing a multifaceted characterization of the coordinated communities that allows obtaining nuanced results. In particular, we uncover three main categories of coordinated users: (i) moderate groups genuinely interested in the electoral debate, (ii) conspiratorial groups that spread false information and divisive narratives, and (iii) foreign influence networks that either sought to tamper with the debate or that exploited it to publicize their own agendas. We also reveal a large use of automation by far-right foreign influence and conspiratorial communities. Conversely, left-leaning supporters were overall less coordinated and engaged primarily in harmless, factual communication. Our results also showed that Twitter was effective at thwarting the activity of some coordinated groups, while it failed on some other equally suspicious ones. Overall, this study advances the understanding of online human interactions and contributes new knowledge to mitigate cyber social threats.",Multifaceted online coordinated behavior in the 2020 US presidential election,Coordinated behavior; Disinformation; Social network,CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE (CNR);ISTITUTO DI INFORMATICA E TELEMATICA (IIT-CNR);UNIVERSITY OF PISA,INST INFORMAT AND TELEMAT,NA,"TARDELLI S, 2024, EPJ DATA SCI","TARDELLI S, 2024, EPJ DATA SCI"

IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT RESULTS FROM A NOVEL SURVEY-EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED USING ACTUAL AI-GENERATED JOURNALISTIC CONTENT. WE TEST WHETHER AUDIENCES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE TRUST IS PARTICULARLY POLARIZED ALONG PARTISAN LINES, PERCEIVE NEWS LABELED AS AI-GENERATED AS MORE OR LESS TRUSTWORTHY. WE FIND ON AVERAGE THAT AUDIENCES PERCEIVE NEWS LABELED AS AI-GENERATED AS LESS TRUSTWORTHY, NOT MORE, EVEN WHEN ARTICLES THEMSELVES ARE NOT EVALUATED AS ANY LESS ACCURATE OR UNFAIR. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT THESE EFFECTS ARE LARGELY CONCENTRATED AMONG THOSE WHOSE PREEXISTING LEVELS OF TRUST IN NEWS ARE HIGHER TO BEGIN WITH AND AMONG THOSE WHO EXHIBIT HIGHER LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT JOURNALISM.

With trust in news already low in many places worldwide, both scholars and practitioners are wary of how the public will respond to news generated through automated methods, prompting calls for labeling of AI-generated content. In this study, we present results from a novel survey-experiment conducted using actual AI-generated journalistic content. We test whether audiences in the United States, where trust is particularly polarized along partisan lines, perceive news labeled as AI-generated as more or less trustworthy. We find on average that audiences perceive news labeled as AI-generated as less trustworthy, not more, even when articles themselves are not evaluated as any less accurate or unfair. Furthermore, we find that these effects are largely concentrated among those whose preexisting levels of trust in news are higher to begin with and among those who exhibit higher levels of knowledge about journalism. We also find that negative effects associated with perceived trustworthiness are largely counteracted when articles disclose the list of sources used to generate the content. As news organizations increasingly look toward adopting AI technologies in their newsrooms, our results hold implications for how disclosure about these techniques may contribute to or further undermine audience confidence in the institution of journalism at a time in which its standing with the public is especially tenuous.","""Or They Could Just Not Use It?"": The Dilemma of AI Disclosure for Audience Trust in News",artificial intelligence; LLMs; news; journalism; trust in news; trust,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,UNIV MINNESOTA,NA,"TOFF B, 2024, INT J PRESS/POLIT","TOFF B, 2024, INT J PRESS/POLIT"

FAKE NEWS DETECTION USING DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS,"WITH THE CURRENT SHIFT IN THE MASS MEDIA LANDSCAPE FROM JOURNALISTIC RIGOR TO SOCIAL MEDIA, PERSONALIZED SOCIAL MEDIA IS BECOMING THE NEW NORM. ALTHOUGH THE DIGITALIZATION PROGRESS OF THE MEDIA BRINGS MANY ADVANTAGES, IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF SPREADING DISINFORMATION, MISINFORMATION, AND MALFORMATION THROUGH THE USE OF FAKE NEWS. THE EMERGENCE OF THIS HARMFUL PHENOMENON HAS MANAGED TO POLARIZE SOCIETY AND MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION ON PARTICULAR TOPICS, E.G., ELECTIONS, VACCINATIONS, ETC. SUCH INFORMATION PROPAGATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA CAN DISTORT PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS AND GENERATE SOCIAL UNREST WHILE LACKING THE RIGOR OF TRADITIONAL JOURNALISM. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING EFFICIENT TOOLS THAT CAN DETECT FAKE NEWS. MODELS THAT USE THE CONTEXT OF TEXTUAL DATA ARE ESSENTIAL FOR RESOLVING THE FAKE NEWS DETECTION PROBLEM, AS THEY MANAGE TO ENCODE LINGUISTIC FEATURES WITHIN THE VECTOR REPRESENTATION OF WORDS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH THAT USES DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS TO BUILD MULTIPLE MODELS THAT ACCURATELY LABEL NEWS ARTICLES AS RELIABLE OR FAKE. WE ALSO PRESENT A BENCHMARK ON DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES THAT DETECT FAKE NEWS USING BINARY OR MULTI-LABELED CLASSIFICATION. WE EVALUATED THE MODELS ON FIVE LARGE NEWS CORPORA USING ACCURACY, PRECISION, AND RECALL. WE OBTAINED BETTER RESULTS THAN MORE COMPLEX STATE-OF-THE-ART DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODELS. WE OBSERVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR OBTAINING HIGH ACCURACY IS THE DOCUMENT ENCODING, NOT THE CLASSIFICATION MODEL'S COMPLEXITY.","TRUICA, CIPRIAN-OCTAVIAN;APOSTOL, ELENA-SIMONA","ALHINDI T., 2018, P 1 WORKSHOP FACT EX, P85, DOI 10.18653/V1/W18-5513, DOI 10.18653/V1/W18-5513;ANONYMOUS, 2015, P ASS INFORM SCI TEC;ARORA S, 2012, ANN IEEE SYMP FOUND, P1, DOI 10.1109/FOCS.2012.49;ASLAM N, 2021, COMPLEXITY, V2021, DOI 10.1155/2021/5557784;BARR√ìN-CEDE√ëO A, 2019, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, P9847;BARR√ìN-CEDE√ëO A, 2019, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V56, P1849, DOI 10.1016/J.IPM.2019.03.005;BASTOS MT, 2019, SOC SCI COMPUT REV, V37, P38, DOI 10.1177/0894439317734157;BOJANOWSKI P., 2017, T ASSOC COMPUT LING, V5, P135, DOI 10.1162/TACLA00051, DOI 10.1162/TACL_A_00051;BOVET A, 2019, NAT COMMUN, V10, DOI 10.1038/S41467-018-07761-2;CHEN TQ, 2016, KDD'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, P785, DOI 10.1145/2939672.2939785;CHO K, 2014, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.3115/V1/W14-4012;CONROY NADIA K., 2015, PROC.

Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity.",It's All in the Embedding!

However, to date, we lack a clear understanding of how people respond to deepfakes, especially when they differ in plausibility and the extremity of the deceptive message. Against this backdrop, this study relies on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of open-ended questions (N = 601) asked after exposure to 3 different political deepfakes. These deepfakes either contained a plausible message or implausible messages with counterattitudinal statements. Distrust in the plausible deepfake was mostly attributed to the insincerity of the depicted politician. The implausible deepfakes, in contrast, were also doubted because of perceived issues with the authenticity of the footage. As a main contribution to the (AI-powered) disinformation literature, we show that the credibility of disinformation is understood in different ways depending on the context of deception, ranging from the plausibility of content to the authenticity of the presentation of synthetic media.",How Far Can Political Deepfakes Credibly Deviate from Reality?

Underlying these interconnected risks is the digital infrastructure of networking sites, making social media a socially disruptive technology. Within this digital context of risk, scholars argue that laypeople's epistemic norm have been disrupted, leading to so-called post-factual attitudes [3]. While various explanations have been given to understand the dynamics in online public debate, the philosophical background commonly implicated is postmodernism [4, 5, 8, 9]. Regulation and design of social media platforms arguably mirror the interpretation that the public sphere has become post-factual. While these regulatory and design solutions have clear effects, the risks ofmisinformation, disinformation and polarization are insufficiently curbed. Thus, more solutions are needed. In view of this, I argue to understand online dynamics from the philosophical perspective of deliberative democracy theory. Specifically, I argue that the character of discourse in online public spheres can be understood in light of three revisions to deliberative democracy theory, namely 1) diversifying acceptable communication styles in deliberations, 2) embracing pluralism, and 3) recognizing that group-based justice claims can be democratically beneficial. This approach provides a positive understanding of online dynamics and inspires alternative strategies to redesign and regulate socialmedia to mitigate the risks of misinformation, disinformation and polarization.",A Positive Perspective to Redesign the Online Public Sphere: A Deliberative Democracy Approach,Post-factualism; Socially Disruptive Technologies; Public Sphere; Social Media Design; Deliberative Democracy Theory,EINDHOVEN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,EINDHOVEN UNIV TECHNOL,NA,"VAN DER PUIL R, 2024, ADV INTELL SYST COMP","VAN DER PUIL R, 2024, ADV INTELL SYST COMP"

We provide a theoretical framework in which we can analyze the effects that microtargeting by political interest groups and unawareness have on election outcomes in comparison to ""conventional"" news reporting. We show which voter groups suffer from which technological development (a) or (b). While both microtargeting and unawareness have negative effects on voter welfare, we show that only unawareness can flip an election. Our model framework allows the theory-based discussion of policy proposals, such as to ban microtargeting or to require news platforms to signal the political orientation of a news item's originator (JEL C72, D72, D82, D83).","Microtargeting, voters' unawareness, and democracy",disinformation; interest groups; news platforms; microtargeting; voter awareness,UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA;TILBURG UNIVERSITY;TILBURG UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA,UNIV VIENNA;W (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);TILBURG UNIV;W (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"VAN GILS F, 2024, J LAW ECON ORGAN","VAN GILS F, 2024, J LAW ECON ORGAN"

THIS STUDY PRESENTS A TWO-PART INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAPABILITIES OF LLMS TO AUTOMATE STAGES OF AN ELECTION DISINFORMATION OPERATION. FIRST, WE INTRODUCE DISELECT, A NOVEL EVALUATION DATASET DESIGNED TO MEASURE LLM COMPLIANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO GENERATE CONTENT FOR AN ELECTION DISINFORMATION OPERATION IN LOCALISED UK CONTEXT, CONTAINING 2,200 MALICIOUS PROMPTS AND 50 BENIGN PROMPTS. USING DISELECT, WE TEST 13 LLMS AND FIND THAT MOST MODELS BROADLY COMPLY WITH THESE REQUESTS; WE ALSO FIND THAT THE FEW MODELS WHICH REFUSE MALICIOUS PROMPTS ALSO REFUSE BENIGN ELECTION-RELATED PROMPTS, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO REFUSE TO GENERATE CONTENT FROM A RIGHT-WING PERSPECTIVE. SECONDLY, WE CONDUCT A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS (N = 2 , 340) TO ASSESS THE ""HUMANNESS"" OF LLMS: THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISINFORMATION OPERATION CONTENT GENERATED BY AN LLM IS ABLE TO PASS AS HUMAN-WRITTEN. OUR EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT ALMOST ALL LLMS TESTED RELEASED SINCE 2022 PRODUCE ELECTION DISINFORMATION OPERATION CONTENT INDISCERNIBLE BY HUMAN EVALUATORS OVER 50% OF THE TIME. NOTABLY, WE OBSERVE THAT MULTIPLE MODELS ACHIEVE ABOVE-HUMAN LEVELS OF HUMANNESS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CURRENT LLMS CAN BE USED TO GENERATE HIGH-QUALITY CONTENT FOR ELECTION DISINFORMATION OPERATIONS, EVEN IN HYPERLOCALISED SCENARIOS, AT FAR LOWER COSTS THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS, AND OFFER RESEARCHERS AND POLICYMAKERS AN EMPIRICAL BENCHMARK FOR THE MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION OF THESE CAPABILITIES IN CURRENT AND FUTURE MODELS.","WILLIAMS, ANGUS R.;BURKE-MOORE, LIAM;CHAN, RYAN SZE-YIN;ENOCK, FLORENCE E.;NANNI, FEDERICO;SIPPY, TVESHA;CHUNG, YI-LING;GABASOVA, EVELINA;HACKENBURG, KOBI;BRIGHT, JONATHAN","ACTIVEFENCE, 2023, LLM SAFETY REVIEW: BENCHMARKS AND ANALYSIS;BASHARDOUST A, 2024, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2402.07395;BLACK SID, 2021, ZENODO;BREWSTER J., 2023, RED-TEAMING FINDS OPENAI'S CHATGPT AND GOOGLE'S BARD STILL SPREAD MISINFORMATION;BUCHANAN BEN, 2021, TRUTH LIES AUTOMATIO;CHAN RSY, 2024, PROMPTO: AN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY FOR ASYNCHRONOUS QUERYING OF LLM ENDPOINTS;CHUNG H.

This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation. First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts. Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N = 2 , 340) to assess the ""humanness"" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written. Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time. Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness. Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.",Large language models can consistently generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations,NA,ALAN TURING INSTITUTE;ALAN TURING INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,ALAN TURING INST,NA,"WILLIAMS AR, 2025, PLOS ONE","WILLIAMS AR, 2025, PLOS ONE"

The evolution of Turkey's digital governance, marked by the enactment of the 'censorship law/disinformation law' in October 2022, represents a deliberate shift toward more entrenched digital authoritarianism. The dissemination of pro-government AI-generated disinformation, particularly targeting opposition during the 2023 national and presidential elections and the 2024 local elections, underscores Turkey's progression towards a more consolidated form of digital authoritarianism. This study examines the impact of recent legislative changes, including the contentious Press Law and Internet Regulation Law, and the role of AI-generated disinformation in shaping Turkey's digital governance.",Hybrid digital authoritarianism in Turkey: the 'Censorship Law' and AI-generated disinformation strategy,Hybrid digital authoritarianism; AI-generated disinformation; censorship law; freedom of expression; Turkish politics,ISTANBUL BILGI UNIVERSITY,ISTANBUL BILGI UNIV,NA,"Y√úCEL A, 2025, TURK STUD","Y√úCEL A, 2025, TURK STUD"

However, it also poses the challenge of fake news, which can mislead and harm individuals physically, and mentally, and incite violence. Fake news is often known as incorrect or misleading information. Prior research used Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for fake news detection. These studies predominantly relied on static offline models, overlooking the dynamic and evolving nature of news patterns, assuming their stability over time. Our paper proposes an incremental ensemble neural network for fake news detection that continuously learns from fake news streams, adapting to changes. It employs performance-based pruning to eliminate underperforming classifiers, improving overall performance. Additionally, the model detects concept drift in real-time and triggers adaptation strategies to maintain accuracy and robustness. The models undergo evaluation in two scenarios, utilizing consistent news patterns for training and testing, demonstrating consistent performance among all ML and incremental models. In the second scenario, the study analyzes the impact of news patterns over time, including concept drift due to significant events like the United States election. The analysis reveals that offline-trained methods are susceptible to performance degradation. However, the proposed model exhibits consistent performance with an accuracy of 97.90% and 99.76% on two fake news datasets, despite changes in the news pattern over time. The findings demonstrate how the evolution of the news pattern impacts the effectiveness of fake news detection models.

THE PRESENT MANUSCRIPT PROVIDES A DETAILED BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE ARTICLES ORIENTED TOWARDS DISINFORMATION DETECTION, INVOLVING HIGH-PERFORMANCE MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THE DATASET HAS BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE POPULAR WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE, THROUGH THE USE OF SPECIFIC KEYWORDS SUCH AS ""DISINFORMATION"", ""MACHINE LEARNING"", OR ""DEEP LEARNING"", FOLLOWED BY A MANUAL CHECK OF THE PAPERS INCLUDED IN THE DATASET. THE DOCUMENTS WERE EXAMINED USING THE POPULAR R TOOL, BIBLIOSHINY 4.2.0; THE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS INCLUDED MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES AND VARIOUS FACETS: DATASET OVERVIEW, SOURCES, AUTHORS, PAPERS, N-GRAM ANALYSIS, AND MIXED ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT AN INCREASED INTEREST FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ON DISINFORMATION TOPICS IN THE CONTEXT OF MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING, SUPPORTED BY AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 96.1%. THE INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THE RESEARCH BRING TO LIGHT SURPRISING DETAILS, WHILE THE STUDY PROVIDES A SOLID BASIS FOR BOTH FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, AS WELL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STRATEGIES ADDRESSING THIS COMPLEX ISSUE OF DISINFORMATION AND ENSURING A TRUSTWORTHY AND SAFE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT.","SANDU, ANDRA;COTFAS, LIVIU-ADRIAN;DELCEA, CAMELIA;IOANAS, CORINA;FLORESCU, MARGARETA-STELA;ORZAN, MIHAI","ABUALIGAH L, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V14, DOI 10.1007/S13278-024-01198-W;ADEBESIN F, 2023, JMIR INFODEMIOL, V3, DOI 10.2196/48620;AHMED SR, 2023, SOFT COMPUT, DOI 10.1007/S00500-023-09245-Y;AKHTAR P, 2023, ANN OPER RES, V327, P633, DOI 10.1007/S10479-022-05015-5;AL-ADWAN A, 2024, COMPUTERS, V13, DOI 10.3390/COMPUTERS13040099;ALGHAMDI J, 2022, INFORMATION, V13, DOI 10.3390/INFO13120576;ALHADLAQ I., 2016, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC ENGINEERING RESEARCH, V7, P960;ALMASOUD AS, 2023, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ, V12, DOI 10.3390/ELECTRONICS12194125;AMER E, 2022, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ, V11, DOI 10.3390/ELECTRONICS11081255;ANA√á M, 2023, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V15, DOI 10.3390/SU151511916;ANONYMOUS, ABOUT US;ARAQUE O, 2017, EXPERT SYST APPL, V77, P236, DOI 10.1016/J.ESWA.2017.02.002;ARIA M, 2017, J INFORMETR, V11, P959, DOI 10.1016/J.JOI.2017.08.007;ARORA S, 2022, EXPERT SYST APPL, V200, DOI 10.1016/J.ESWA.2022.117000;ARUNTHAVACHELVAN K, 2024, USER MODEL USER-ADAP, V34, P1043, DOI 10.1007/S11257-024-09413-1;BAINES D, 2020, DISCUSS PAP;BAKIR M, 2022, J AIR TRANSP MANAG, V104, DOI 10.1016/J.JAIRTRAMAN.2022.102273;BARBADO R, 2019, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V56, P1234, DOI 10.1016/J.IPM.2019.03.002;BATTISTA D., 2023, GEOPOLIT.

Disinformation can be classified as a subdivision of fake news, the main purpose of which is to manipulate and generate confusion among people in order to influence their opinion and obtain certain advantages in multiple domains (politics, economics, etc.). Propaganda, rumors, and conspiracy theories are just a few examples of common disinformation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand this phenomenon and offer the scientific community a paper that provides a comprehensive examination of the existing literature, lay the foundation for future research areas, and contribute to the fight against disinformation. The present manuscript provides a detailed bibliometric analysis of the articles oriented towards disinformation detection, involving high-performance machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The dataset has been collected from the popular Web of Science database, through the use of specific keywords such as ""disinformation"", ""machine learning"", or ""deep learning"", followed by a manual check of the papers included in the dataset. The documents were examined using the popular R tool, Biblioshiny 4.2.0; the bibliometric analysis included multiple perspectives and various facets: dataset overview, sources, authors, papers, n-gram analysis, and mixed analysis. The results highlight an increased interest from the scientific community on disinformation topics in the context of machine learning and deep learning, supported by an annual growth rate of 96.1%. The insights gained from the research bring to light surprising details, while the study provides a solid basis for both future research in this area, as well for the development of new strategies addressing this complex issue of disinformation and ensuring a trustworthy and safe online environment.",Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications in Disinformation Detection: A Bibliometric Assessment,disinformation; social media; bibliometric analysis; n-gram analysis; Biblioshiny,BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST UNIV ECON STUDIES,NA,"SANDU A, 2024, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ","SANDU A, 2024, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ"

THUS, IT IS CRUCIAL TO ANALYZE AND EVALUATE DETECTION METHODS FOR FAKE NEWS. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE DETECTION OF ROMANIAN FAKE NEWS. IN THIS STUDY, WE MADE A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND TRANSFORMER-BASED MODELS ON ROMANIAN FAKE NEWS DETECTION USING THREE DATASETS-FAKEROM, NEW, AND BOTH FAKEROM + NEW. THE NEW DATASET WAS BUILD USING A SCRAPPING ALGORITHM APPLIED ON THE VERIDICA PLATFORM. OUR APPROACH USES THE FOLLOWING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR DETECTION: NAIVE BAYES (NB), LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM). WE ALSO USED TWO TRANSFORMER-BASED MODELS-BERT-BASED-MULTILINGUAL-CASED AND ROBERTA-LARGE.

Thus, it is crucial to analyze and evaluate detection methods for fake news. This paper focuses on the detection of Romanian fake news. In this study, we made a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms and Transformer-based models on Romanian fake news detection using three datasets-FakeRom, NEW, and both FakeRom + NEW. The NEW dataset was build using a scrapping algorithm applied on the Veridica platform. Our approach uses the following machine learning models for detection: Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We also used two Transformer-based models-BERT-based-multilingual-cased and RoBERTa-large. The performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results revealed that the BERT model trained on the NEW dataset consistently achieved the highest performance metrics across all test sets, with 96.5%.

Confronting this dilemma necessitates an effective and accurate approach to identifying misinformation, an intrinsically intricate process. This research introduces an automated and efficient method for detecting false information. We evaluated the efficacy of various machine learning and deep learning models on two separate fake news datasets of differing sizes via holdout cross-validation. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of three distinct word vectorization methods. Additionally, we employed an enhanced weighted voting ensemble model that enhances fake news detection by integrating logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This method exhibits enhanced performance relative to previous techniques: 98.76% for the PolitiFact dataset and 97.67% for the BuzzFeed dataset. Furthermore, the model outperforms individual components, resulting in superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The enhancements in performance result from the ensemble method's capacity to use the advantages of each base model, hence providing robust generalization across datasets.

WITH THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND EVER- INCREASING INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY, NEWS SPREADS LIKE WILDFIRE TO MILLIONS OF USERS IN A VERY SHORT TIME. THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS CAN HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES, FROM DECREASED TRUST IN NEWS OUTLETS TO OVERTURNED ELECTIONS. SUCH CONCERNS CALL FOR AUTOMATED TOOLS TO DETECT FAKE NEWS ARTICLES. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT CAN CHECK THE AUTHENTICITY OF A NEWS ARTICLE. THE MODEL IS CONSTRUCTED USING TWO DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO CONSTRUCT OUR MODEL: (1) LINGUISTIC FEATURES AND (2) FEATURE EXTRACTION. WE EMPLOYED SOME WIDELY USED TRADITIONAL (E.G. K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR (KNN) AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)) AS WELL AS STATE-OF-THE-ART (E.G. BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) AND EXTREME MACHINE LEARNING (ELM)) MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS USING FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS AND LINGUISTIC FEATURES. AFTER GENERATING THE MODELS, PERFORMANCE METRICS (E.G. ACCURACY AND PRECISION) ARE USED TO COMPARE THEIR PERFORMANCE.

With the rise of social media and ever- increasing internet accessibility, news spreads like wildfire to millions of users in a very short time. The spread of fake news can have disastrous consequences, from decreased trust in news outlets to overturned elections. Such concerns call for automated tools to detect fake news articles. This study proposes a predictive model that can check the authenticity of a news article. The model is constructed using two different techniques to construct our model: (1) linguistic features and (2) feature extraction. We employed some widely used traditional (e.g. K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM)) as well as state-of-the-art (e.g. bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and extreme machine learning (ELM)) machine learning algorithms using feature extraction methods and linguistic features. After generating the models, performance metrics (e.g. accuracy and precision) are used to compare their performance. The model generated via logistic regression using feature hashing vectorisation emerged as the best model, with 99% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no extant studies have compared the traditional and contemporary methods in this context and demonstrated the traditional ones to be better performers. The fake news detection model can help curb the spread of fake news by acting as a tool for news organisations to check the authenticity of a news article.",Fake News Detection: Traditional vs. Contemporary Machine Learning Approaches,Fake news; machine learning; confusion matrix; linguistic features; feature extraction; state-of-the-art methods,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA;NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS;UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA;UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,WATAUGA HIGH SCH;NORTH CAROLINA SCH SCI AND MATH,NA,"BINAY A, 2024, J INF KNOWL MANAG","BINAY A, 2024, J INF KNOWL MANAG"

THE FAST FLOW OF INFORMATION AND THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF USERS OPENS THE DOOR TO THE PUBLICATION OF NON-TRUTHFUL NEWS, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REACH MANY PEOPLE. DISSEMINATING THIS NEWS THROUGH LOW- OR NO-COST CHANNELS RESULTED IN A FLOOD OF FAKE NEWS THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT BY HUMANS. SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS ARE ONE OF THESE CHANNELS THAT ARE USED TO QUICKLY SPREAD THIS FAKE NEWS BY MANIPULATING IT IN WAYS THAT INFLUENCE READERS IN MANY ASPECTS. THAT INFLUENCE APPEARS IN A RECENT EXAMPLE AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND VARIOUS POLITICAL EVENTS SUCH AS THE RECENT US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. GIVEN HOW THIS PHENOMENON IMPACTS SOCIETY, IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND IT WELL AND STUDY MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW ITS TIMELY DETECTION. DEEP LEARNING (DL) HAS PROVEN ITS POTENTIAL FOR MULTIPLE COMPLEX TASKS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH OUTSTANDING RESULTS. IN PARTICULAR, MULTIPLE SPECIALIZED SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TASKS.

The fast flow of information and the enormous number of users opens the door to the publication of non-truthful news, which has the potential to reach many people. Disseminating this news through low- or no-cost channels resulted in a flood of fake news that is difficult to detect by humans. Social media networks are one of these channels that are used to quickly spread this fake news by manipulating it in ways that influence readers in many aspects. That influence appears in a recent example amid the COVID-19 pandemic and various political events such as the recent US presidential elections. Given how this phenomenon impacts society, it is crucial to understand it well and study mechanisms that allow its timely detection. Deep learning (DL) has proven its potential for multiple complex tasks in the last few years with outstanding results. In particular, multiple specialized solutions have been put forward for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we systematically review existing fake news detection (FND) strategies that use DL techniques. We systematically surveyed the existing research articles by investigating the DL algorithms used in the detection process. Our focus then shifts to the datasets utilized in previous research and the effectiveness of the different DL solutions. Special attention was given to the application of strategies for transfer learning and dealing with the class imbalance problem. The effect of these solutions on the detection accuracy is also discussed. Finally, our survey provides an overview of key challenges that remain unsolved in the context of FND.",Fake News Detection Using Deep Learning: A Systematic Literature Review,Classification algorithms; Systematic literature review; Classification; deep learning; fake news; misinformation; systematic literature review; Classification algorithms; Systematic literature review; Classification; deep learning; fake news; misinformation; systematic literature review,UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA,UNIV OTTAWA,NA,"ALNABHAN MQ, 2024, IEEE ACCESS","ALNABHAN MQ, 2024, IEEE ACCESS"

The manipulation of digital news to spread misinformation has become a common practice for personal benefits or relief. Therefore, developing an automated system that can detect fake news before publication is crucial. This study proposes a three-level methodology with a new model called Multi-Kernel Optimized Convolutional Neural Network (MOCNN) to investigate its effectiveness for fake news detection. The parameters of the proposed model have been optimized using the grid search technique. We evaluated ten different deep learning models on two benchmark datasets of fake news articles and compared their performance with the proposed model. Finding the best model with good accuracy performance is the primary goal of this paper. F-measure and accuracy are used to evaluate and compare the classification performance of these deep learning models. Our proposed model achieves 85.8% and 68.2% accuracy and 85.8% and 67.7% F1-measure on UFN and BET, respectively. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model performs better than other models on UFN and BET datasets.",A Multi-Kernel Optimized Convolutional Neural Network With Urdu Word Embedding to Detect Fake News,Fake news; Urdu fake news; machine learning; ensemble learning; dagging,GOVERNMENT COLLEGE UNIVERSITY FAISALABAD,GOVT COLL UNIV FAISALABAD,NA,"ZAHEER K, 2023, IEEE ACCESS","ZAHEER K, 2023, IEEE ACCESS"

AS IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND SHAPE OUR LIVES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF THESE PLATFORMS. ONE OF THESE RISKS IS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION OVER GLOBAL PLATFORMS LIKE TWITTER. THE RAPID DISSEMINATION OF FALSE INFORMATION CAN HAVE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES, INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION AND POTENTIALLY LEADING TO REAL-WORLD HARM. ONE CRITICAL AREA OF CONCERN IS THE IMPACT OF FAKE NEWS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES ELICITED BY FAKE NEWS AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF FALSE INFORMATION CIRCULATED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. TO ACHIEVE THIS, A NOVEL ENSEMBLE HARD VOTING CLASSIFIER (EHVC), WHICH ACCURATELY CLASSIFIES TWEETS AS EITHER FAKE OR REAL WITH AN ACCURACY OF 93.84% HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. ADDITIONALLY, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED, YIELDING AN ACCURACY OF 83.02%. THESE TWO STAND-ALONE MODELS ARE THEN INTEGRATED INTO A UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE THAT ANALYZES THE SENTIMENTS TRIGGERED BY FAKE NEWS IN REAL-TIME USING THE TWITTER API. ADDITIONALLY, THIS RESEARCH VALIDATES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAKE NEWS AND SENTIMENTS IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT DEGRADING MENTAL HEALTH IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF FAKE NEWS BY EMPLOYING THE PEARSON'S CHI-SQUARED TEST FOR INDEPENDENCE. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY RESULTS HAVE ALSO BEEN COMPARED AND ANALYZED AGAINST CONVENTIONAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFICACY OF THE EHVC MODEL.

As it continues to evolve and shape our lives, it is important to consider both the benefits and the potential risks of these platforms. One of these risks is the spread of misinformation over global platforms like Twitter. The rapid dissemination of false information can have far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion and potentially leading to real-world harm. One critical area of concern is the impact of fake news on mental health and well-being. This study aims to explore the emotional responses elicited by fake news and provide insights into the psychological effects of false information circulated through social media. To achieve this, a novel Ensemble Hard Voting Classifier (EHVC), which accurately classifies tweets as either fake or real with an accuracy of 93.84% has been developed. Additionally, sentiment analysis has been conducted, yielding an accuracy of 83.02%. These two stand-alone models are then integrated into a unified architecture that analyzes the sentiments triggered by fake news in real-time using the Twitter API. Additionally, this research validates the significance of the relationship between fake news and sentiments in order to substantiate that degrading mental health is a direct consequence of fake news by employing the Pearson's Chi-Squared test for independence. The proposed methodology results have also been compared and analyzed against conventional machine learning algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy of the EHVC model. This research not only highlights the psychological impacts of fake news but also underscores the importance of addressing misinformation on social media platforms.",Sentimental impact of fake news on social media using an integrated ensemble framework,Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Ensemble; Fake news; Social media,ALLIANCE UNIVERSITY,ALLIANCE UNIV,NA,"ARORA S, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN","ARORA S, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN"

SOME FALSE OR FAKE INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF ""GOVERNMENT LETTERS OR RESOLUTIONS, RELIGIOUS COMMENTS, HATE SPEECH, AND SO ON"" HAS SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE MAJOR SOCIAL ISSUES AFFECTING AREAS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT, POLITICS, HEALTHCARE, POVERTY, RELIGIOUS CLEAVAGES, ETC. DUE TO THE VAST AVAILABILITY OF SIMILAR DATASETS COMPRISING THESE TYPES OF INFORMATION, MANUAL DETECTION OF FAKE NEWS OR FALSE INFORMATION IS CHALLENGING.

A massive amount of information is currently being disseminated on the Internet via various social networking accounts. Some false or fake information in the form of ""government letters or resolutions, religious comments, hate speech, and so on"" has spread like wildfire. As a result, there are major social issues affecting areas such as unemployment, politics, healthcare, poverty, religious cleavages, etc. Due to the vast availability of similar datasets comprising these types of information, manual detection of fake news or false information is challenging. This issue requires immediate attention in terms of automatically finding false news. With this motivation, we present a novel 'ConFake' algorithm. This algorithm includes an eighty content-based feature set for identifying fake news. Content-based and word vector features extracted from the textual content of news stories were used in the experiment. These characteristics were combined and input into machine learning classifiers. To validate the experimental findings, we ran all of the experiments on five publicly available datasets and one synthetically generated ConFake dataset that combined five datasets, namely: Kaggle, McIntire, Reuter, BuzzFeed, and PolitiFact. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 97.31% when compared to other cutting-edge models.",ConFake: fake news identification using content based features,Social media; Machine learning; Fake news; Linguistic features; Word embedding,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT SYSTEM);MALAVIYA NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY JAIPUR,MALAVIYA NATL INST TECHNOL,NA,"JAIN MK, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL","JAIN MK, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL"

Existing approaches, primarily using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised Machine Learning, achieve strong results under cross-validation and hold-out testing but struggle to generalise to other datasets, even those within the same domain. This limitation stems from reliance on coarsely labelled training datasets, where articles are often labelled based on their publisher, introducing biases that token-based representations such as TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive to. While Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising development in NLP, their application to fake news detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful features can still be extracted from coarsely labelled datasets to improve model robustness for real-world scenarios. Stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, and semantic attributes, are explored as an alternative due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. In addition, novel 'social-monetisation' features are introduced, capturing economic incentives behind fake news, such as the presence of advertisements, external links, and social media sharing elements. The study employs the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset for training and the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset for external validation, representing a gold standard for evaluating model generalisability. The results highlight the limitations of token-based models, when trained on coarsely labelled data. Additionally, this study contributes to the limited evidence on the performance of LLMs such as LLaMa in this domain. The findings indicate that stylistic features, complemented by social-monetisation attributes, provide more generalisable predictions for real-world scenarios in comparison to token-based methods and LLMs. Statistical and permutation feature importance analyses further reveal the potential of these features to enhance performance and address dataset biases, offering a path forward for improving fake news detection models.",An exploration of features to improve the generalisability of fake news detection models,Fake news; Misinformation; Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Feature engineering; Generalisability,BRUNEL UNIVERSITY,BRUNEL UNIV LONDON,NA,"HOY N, 2025, EXPERT SYST APPL","HOY N, 2025, EXPERT SYST APPL"

THEY SERVE AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND CAN HELP TO EDUCATE AND INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS AND ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, NEWSPAPERS CAN PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND OPINIONS, WHICH CAN HELP TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. SINCE A LARGE SECTION OF THE PUBLIC NOW TURNS TO INTERNET SOURCES RATHER THAN TRADITIONAL PRINT OR BROADCAST MEDIA FOR NEWS AND INFORMATION, THE TREND OF DIGITAL NEWS HAS GAINED MAJOR SUPPORT. THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIGITAL NEWS. ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THE PROLIFERATION OF FAKE NEWS AND MISINFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, DIGITAL NEWS IS OFTEN SUBJECT TO ALGO-RITHMICALLY DRIVEN PERSONALIZATION, WHICH CAN LEAD TO A LACK OF DIVERSITY AND BALANCE IN THE INFORMATION THAT IS PRESENTED TO PEOPLE. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY WITH THREE KEY ASPECTS TO PROCESS AND ANALYSE THE GROWING DIGITAL NEWS ARTICLES. THE NEWS DATA IS COLLECTED, ANALYSED AND CLASSIFIED INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS.

FROM THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE, MOST STUDIES FOCUSED ON FAKE NEWS DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION AND FAKE NEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING OR DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY FEW RESEARCHERS HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO FAKE NEWS ANALYSIS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR FAKE POLITICAL NEWS. UNLIKE OTHER PUBLISHED WORKS WHICH BUILT FAKE NEWS DETECTION MODELS FROM COMPUTER SCIENTISTS' VIEWPOINTS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE METHOD THAT COMBINES NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA) USING SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD) TECHNIQUES TO HELP SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO ANALYZE FAKE NEWS FOR DISCOVERING THE EXACT ELEMENTS.

From the available literature, most studies focused on fake news detection and identification and fake news sentiment analysis using machine learning or deep learning techniques. However, relatively few researchers have paid attention to fake news analysis. This is especially true for fake political news. Unlike other published works which built fake news detection models from computer scientists' viewpoints, this study aims to develop an effective method that combines natural language processing (NLP) and latent semantic analysis (LSA) using singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to help social scientists to analyze fake news for discovering the exact elements. In addition, the authors analyze the characteristics of true news and fake news. A real case from the USA election campaign in 2016 is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

The proliferation of misinformation on various social media platforms has serious consequences for society. The inability to differentiate between the several forms of false news on Twitter is a major obstacle to effective detection of fake news. Researchers have made progress toward a solution by emphasizing methods for identifying fake news. The dataset FNC-1, which includes four categories for identifying false news, will be used in this study. The state-of-the-art methods for spotting fake news are evaluated and compared using big data technology (Spark) and machine learning. The methodology of this study employed a decentralized Spark cluster to create a stacked ensemble model. Following feature extraction using N-grams, Hashing TF-IDF, and count vectorizer, we used the proposed stacked ensemble classification model. The results show that the suggested model has a superior classification performance of 92.45% in the F1 score compared to the 83.10 % F1 score of the baseline approach. The proposed model achieved an additional 9.35% F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.",Big Data ML-Based Fake News Detection Using Distributed Learning,Social networking (online); Fake news; Blogs; Task analysis; Voting; Big Data; Behavioral sciences; Machine learning; Ensemble learning; Big data; machine learning; fake news; ensemble learning; social media,KING SAUD UNIVERSITY,KING SAUD UNIV,NA,"ALTHENEYAN A, 2023, IEEE ACCESS","ALTHENEYAN A, 2023, IEEE ACCESS"

MULTI-DOMAIN NEWS REFERS TO HANDLING DIVERSE CONTENT ACROSS VARIOUS SUBJECT AREAS SUCH AS POLITICS, HEALTH, RESEARCH, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONCERNS. RECOGNIZING THE LACK OF SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH IN MULTI-DOMAIN FAKE NEWS DETECTION, WE PRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURE BY COMBINING DATASETS FROM SEVERAL NEWS DOMAINS. OUR TWO-TIERED DETECTION APPROACH, BERTGUARD, STARTS WITH DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION, WHICH USES A BERT-BASED MODEL TRAINED ON A COMBINED MULTI-DOMAIN DATASET TO DETERMINE THE DOMAIN OF A GIVEN NEWS PIECE. FOLLOWING THAT, DOMAIN-SPECIFIC BERT MODELS EVALUATE THE CORRECTNESS OF NEWS INSIDE EACH DESIGNATED DOMAIN, ASSURING PRECISION AND RELIABILITY TAILORED TO EACH DOMAIN'S UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. RIGOROUS TESTING ON PREVIOUSLY ENCOUNTERED DATASETS FROM CRITICAL LIFE AREAS SUCH AS POLITICS, HEALTH, RESEARCH, CRIME, AND SOCIETY PROVES THE SYSTEM'S PERFORMANCE AND GENERALIZABILITY. FOR ADDRESSING THE CLASS IMBALANCE CHALLENGES INHERENT WHEN COMBINING DATASETS, OUR STUDY RIGOROUSLY EVALUATES THE IMPACT ON DETECTION ACCURACY AND EXPLORES HANDLING ALTERNATIVES-RANDOM OVERSAMPLING, RANDOM UPSAMPLING, AND CLASS WEIGHT ADJUSTMENT. THESE CRITERIA PROVIDE BASELINES FOR COMPARISON, FORTIFYING THE DETECTION SYSTEM AGAINST THE COMPLEXITIES OF IMBALANCED DATASETS.","ALNABHAN, MOHAMMAD Q.;BRANCO, PAULA","AGARWAL I.

Multi-domain news refers to handling diverse content across various subject areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and social concerns. Recognizing the lack of systematic research in multi-domain fake news detection, we present a fundamental structure by combining datasets from several news domains. Our two-tiered detection approach, BERTGuard, starts with domain classification, which uses a BERT-based model trained on a combined multi-domain dataset to determine the domain of a given news piece. Following that, domain-specific BERT models evaluate the correctness of news inside each designated domain, assuring precision and reliability tailored to each domain's unique characteristics. Rigorous testing on previously encountered datasets from critical life areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and society proves the system's performance and generalizability. For addressing the class imbalance challenges inherent when combining datasets, our study rigorously evaluates the impact on detection accuracy and explores handling alternatives-random oversampling, random upsampling, and class weight adjustment. These criteria provide baselines for comparison, fortifying the detection system against the complexities of imbalanced datasets.",BERTGuard: Two-Tiered Multi-Domain Fake News Detection with Class Imbalance Mitigation,domain classification; fake news; class imbalance; deep learning,UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA,UNIV OTTAWA,NA,"ALNABHAN MQ, 2024, BIG DATA COGN COMPUT","ALNABHAN MQ, 2024, BIG DATA COGN COMPUT"

However, a concerning trend has emerged with the rapid spread of fake news, attributed to the lack of verification mechanisms. Fake news has far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, disrupting democracy, fueling social tensions, and impacting various domains such as health, environment, and the economy. In order to identify fake news with data sparsity especially with low resources languages such as Arabic and its dialects, we propose a few-shot learning fake news detection model based on sentence transformer fine tuning, utilizing no crafted prompts and language model with few parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve higher performances with fewer news samples. This approach provided 71% F1 score on the Algerian dialect fake news dataset and 70% F1 score on the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) version of the same dataset, which prove that the approach can work on the standard Arabic and its dialects. Therefore, the proposed model can identify fake news in several domains concerning the Algerian community such as politics, COVID-19, tourism, ecommerce, sport, accidents and cars prices.",Fake News Detection in Low Resource Languages using SetFit Framework,Fake News; Algerian Dialect; Social Media; Deep Learning; Few-Shot Learning; Normalization; MSA; Arabic; BERT,AHMED DRAIA UNIV;GESIS INST SOCIAL SCI,AHMED DRAIA UNIV,NA,"ABDEDAIEM A, 2023, INTELIGENCIA ARTIFIC","ABDEDAIEM A, 2023, INTELIGENCIA ARTIFIC"

This permits the very quick spread of fake news globally and misleads the people against democracy and freedom. The content of fake news very closely resembles true news. So, technically, it is tough for a deep neural network to 'detect and attend to' the 'fake only' aspects of a news article. Fake news detection is a significantly complex and challenging task from the aspect of deep learning-based attention mechanisms. The deep learning-based fake news detection systems suffer from indistinguishability of fake and real news/data, the curse of high dimensionality, the high training time of deep neural networks, the over-fitting of the network training, and the over-thinking problem. In this paper, a shallow-based convolution neural networks (SCNN) model has been proposed for the fake news detection system to overcome the mentioned issues. The proposed SCNN model is experimentally tested for a complex benchmark LIAR dataset. The performance of the proposed SCNN is better than other existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.",A shallow-based neural network model for fake news detection in social networks,attention mechanism; deep learning; optimisation; natural language processing; NLP; convolution neural networks; CNN,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT SYSTEM);NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY TIRUCHIRAPPALLI,NATL INST TECHNOL TIRUCHIRAPPALLI,NA,"RAMYA SP, 2023, INT J INF COMPUT SEC","RAMYA SP, 2023, INT J INF COMPUT SEC"

Consequently, the exponential growth of fake news poses a serious threat, as it has been extensively exploited to manipulate public opinion and undermine trust in reliable sources. Machine learning classifiers have been employed in previous studies to address this issue. Existing work in text classification often overlooks the incorporation of contextual information, a gap that our proposed methodology seeks to fill. Our approach distinguishes itself by employing sophisticated text preprocessing techniques to capture subtle linguistic features, thereby enhancing the overall understanding of the text. Furthermore, we draw inspiration from ensemble machine learning strategies to bolster our methodology. We adopt a voting system, wherein the most frequently predicted class by five distinct classifiers is chosen. This ensemble method helps us address the inherent limitations of individual classifiers and improve the robustness of our results. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of five individual classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Stochastic Gradient Descent) along with their combination using our ensemble voting technique. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets of varying sizes and contexts for evaluation.

Deep learning and ensemble deep learning (EDL) are widely used strategies that consistently provide exceptional performance across several tasks. EDL is a novel advancement that combines these two approaches to provide a robust framework with significant performance improvements and enhanced generalization capabilities compared to the individual techniques. This paper presents the concept of ensemble deep learning and provides a comprehensive analysis of the utilization of EDL techniques in various application domains like image recognition, sentimental analysis and text classification, cancerous tumor classification, speech, healthcare, fake news and fraud detection forecasting, and other applications. We offer an analysis of various ensemble strategies, including bagging, boosting, stacking, negative correlation-based deep ensemble models, explicit/implicit ensembles, homogeneous/heterogeneous ensembles, and decision fusion techniques-based deep ensemble models. The main objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate existing works in the area of EDL and highlight the future directions that may be explored further to develop it as a tool for several application domain-related tasks. This first study primarily focuses on ensemble deep learning for smart healthcare and other related domain-specific applications. This study aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers in academia and industry working with medical data, supporting advanced novel applications of ensemble deep learning models to solve challenges in existing medical decision-processing systems.",A fundamental overview of ensemble deep learning models and applications: systematic literature and state of the art,Bagging; Base learner; Bias-variance decomposition; Boosting; Computational complexity; Consensus; Ensemble deep learning; Fusion strategies; Model diversity; Stacking; Voting,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT SYSTEM);NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY UTTARAKHAND;INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE (IISC) - BANGALORE;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (NIT SYSTEM);NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY UTTARAKHAND,NATL INST TECHNOL NIT,NA,"SHAIKH TA, 2024, ANN OPER RES","SHAIKH TA, 2024, ANN OPER RES"

This study introduces a method that utilizes a combination of Deep Learning (DL) techniques for identifying fake news-related messages on social networks. Each deep model receives unique representations of the message's content features, and the process begins with preprocessing the content to obtain a standardized intermediate form. Three DL models are employed: the first is a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers, which processes statistical features of the message and detects fakeness based on content properties and dissemination statistics. The second and third models are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained using TF-IDF and Word2Vec attributes, considering the content features of the message in detecting fake news. After training these models, they are then used for recognizing fake news in new samples. The presented method used a decision tree-based learning model in the final step for result ensemble. In comparison to conventional ensemble systems like majority voting, this approach significantly increases the flexibility of the model. In our experiments, we utilized two databases: GossipCop and PolitiFact. Our proposed method performed well in both databases, achieving an average accuracy of 99% and 96% respectively. This demonstrates that our approach outperforms comparative methods in detection.",Recognizing fake news spreading in social networks using ensemble learning,Text processing deep ensemble learning; social networks; fake news,CHENGDU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;SICHUAN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA;CHENGDU UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;SICHUAN UNIVERSITY,CHENGDU UNIV TRADIT CHINESE MED,NA,"YANG Y, 2025, J INF TECHNOL POLITI","YANG Y, 2025, J INF TECHNOL POLITI"

TO ADDRESS THIS, OUR RESEARCH INTRODUCES ROBERTA-GCN, A CUTTING-EDGE MODEL COMBINING ROBERTA WITH A GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK (GCN) TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY FAKE NEWS IN BANGLADESH. THE DATASET WE UTILIZED COMPRISES ARTICLES FROM 22 PROMINENT BANGLADESHI NEWS PORTALS COVERING DIVERSE SUBJECTS SUCH AS POLITICS, SPORTS, ECONOMY, AND ENTERTAINMENT. THIS COMPREHENSIVE DATASET ENABLES THE MODEL TO LEARN AND ADAPT TO THE INTRICACIES OF THE BANGLA LANGUAGE AND ITS NEWS ECOSYSTEM, FACILITATING EFFECTIVE FAKE NEWS DETECTION ACROSS VARIOUS CONTENT CATEGORIES. OUR APPROACH INTEGRATES THE ROBERTA MODEL, ADAPTED FOR BANGLA, WITH GCN'S EXPERTISE IN PROCESSING RELATIONAL DATA, FORMING AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN AUTHENTIC AND FAKE NEWS.

Fake news is a critical issue in Bangla, a language that a vast population uses but lacks adequate natural language processing tools. To address this, our research introduces RoBERTa-GCN, a cutting-edge model combining RoBERTa with a graph neural network (GCN) to accurately identify fake news in Bangladesh. The dataset we utilized comprises articles from 22 prominent Bangladeshi news portals covering diverse subjects such as politics, sports, economy, and entertainment. This comprehensive dataset enables the model to learn and adapt to the intricacies of the Bangla language and its news ecosystem, facilitating effective fake news detection across various content categories. Our approach integrates the RoBERTa model, adapted for Bangla, with GCN's expertise in processing relational data, forming an effective means to differentiate between authentic and fake news. This study's key achievement is the creation and application of the RoBERTa-GCN model to the Bangla language, an area not thoroughly explored in previous research. The findings show that RoBERTa-GCN surpasses existing methods, achieving impressive accuracy rates of 98.60%, highlighting its capability as a robust model for preserving news integrity in the digital era, especially for the Bangla-speaking population.",RoBERTa-GCN: A Novel Approach for Combating Fake News in Bangla Using Advanced Language Processing and Graph Convolutional Networks,Fake news; Social networking (online); Accuracy; Data models; Support vector machines; Long short term memory; Feature extraction; Fake news detection; graph neural network; NLP; Bangla language; deep learning; machine learning; encoder,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BANGLADESH (AIUB);SUNGKYUNKWAN UNIVERSITY (SKKU);UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA;KHULNA UNIVERSITY;NOAKHALI SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY (NSTU);ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY;ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE;LAPPEENRANTA-LAHTI UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY LUT,LUT UNIV,NA,"AHAMMAD M, 2024, IEEE ACCESS","AHAMMAD M, 2024, IEEE ACCESS"

The proliferation of fake news in various fields, such as politics and health, has made the exploration of multi-domain fake news detection methods a hot topic in the field. This paper introduces a novel multi-domain fake news detection model, ATTFEND, which incorporates a serial attention network to efficiently extract high-quality features from news samples in different domains, thereby improving the accuracy of fake news detection. The ATTFEND model uses a series of attention networks to capture the feature representation of news, passing through Eca-Attention, Double-Eca-Attention, and Mask-Attention networks to achieve deep extraction and enhancement of news sample features. In particular, the Double-Eca-Attention network further enhances the capture of high-quality features in news samples through a two-layer convolution operation, while the Mask-Attention network focuses on optimizing the sentence-level feature representation. In addition, the ATTFEND model incorporates BatchNorm2d normalization to accelerate model convergence and improve detection performance. Experimental results on the Weibo21 dataset show that the ATTFEND model outperforms existing technologies in multi-domain fake news detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and superiority of serial attention networks combined with normalization in multi-domain fake news detection.",Multi-Domain Fake News Detection Based on Serial Attention Networks,Fake news; Fake news detection; Multi-domain; Serial attention networks; High-quality features,CHENGDU UNIVERSITY OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,CHENGDU UNIV INFORMAT TECHNOL,NA,"QIU CF, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF 2024 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER SECURITY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DIGITAL ECONOMY, CSAIDE 2024","QIU CF, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF 2024 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER SECURITY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DIGITAL ECONOMY, CSAIDE 2024"

Fake news ' s notorious role in the political and economic realities of the country is not uncommon, as it has created uncountable political controversies. With several of the country ' s media owned by politicians or persons with a vested interest in politics, it became a practice for players to utilise fake news as a propaganda tool to outwit their competitors through the media. For these architects to fully achieve their goal, social media and affiliated mainstream media were used as instruments to propagate fabricated content against their opponents, especially during the 2020 general elections. This paper also identified the use of artificial intelligence and robotics in the creation of fake news content.

Preliminary analysis shows that posts sharing real news and fake news are disseminated on social media. Moreover, posts pointing to fake news spread faster, so this paper aims to predict the impact of posts citing fake news on social platforms. In this study, we take into account that exogenous factors, in addition to endogenous factors, can potentially determine how influential a post is. For example, the occurrence of social events can generate public resonance and discussion, thereby increasing the impact of relevant posts. Given that Google Trends can obtain search trends that reflect social popularity, this work aims to use Google Trends as the source of our exogenous factors. We propose a deep learning model called the deep exogenous aid in fake news (ExoFIA) model, which combines multi-modal features and utilizes an attention mechanism to provide model interpretability and analyze the influencing factors. Applying the model to real-world data from Twitter demonstrates that our model outperforms existing diffusion models. Furthermore, further examination of the relevant aspects of true and fake news reveals that the two are influenced by distinct variables.",ExoFIA: Deep Exogenous Assistance in the Prediction of the Influence of Fake News with Social Media Explainability,fake news; popularity prediction; exogenous factors; multi-modal learning; model interpretability,NATIONAL CHENG KUNG UNIVERSITY;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,NA,"LI PX, 2023, APPL SCI-BASEL","LI PX, 2023, APPL SCI-BASEL"

FAKE NEWS HAS BECOME A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON IN THE CONSUMPTION OF ONLINE INFORMATION, AS IT IS OFTEN DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE REAL NEWS AND IS WIDELY SHARED ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. CONCERNS REGARDING THE POSSIBLE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF FAKE NEWS ON THE PUBLIC'S KNOWLEDGE OF EVENTS AND TOPICS, AS WELL AS ON DEMOCRACY AND PUBLIC DISCOURSE IN GENERAL, HAVE ARISEN AS A RESULT OF THE RISE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF A SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR FROM HISTORICAL RESEARCH, CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS, AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN THE FORM OF A CASE STUDY METHOD. WITH THE AIM OF ANALYZING ONLINE FORUMS AND THE CONCEPT OF DISINFORMATION USING FAKE NEWS, ITS IMPLICATIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT PROVOKE REFLECTION ON THIS PHENOMENON. IN THE RESULTS, WE PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING AND EVALUATING THE CONCEPTS OF FAKE NEWS AND ITS INTERACTION WITH OTHER FORMS OF ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING WHETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE SATISFACTORY RESULTS WITH A REDUCED AMOUNT OF SEARCHED TEXT. THE DESIRE IS TO OBSERVE WHETHER WE CAN USE OUR PROPOSED PROCEDURE WITH THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH THE VADER BERT MODEL IN COMBINATION WITH THE INTENSITY OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF SENTIMENT.","STUPAVSKY, IGOR;DAKIC, PAVLE;VRANIC, VALENTINO","ALGHAMDI J, 2023, APPL SCI-BASEL, V13, DOI 10.3390/APP13053345;ANONYMOUS, 2023, POLITIFACT POLITIFACT-THE POYNTER INSTITUTE;ANONYMOUS, 2023, RURALLURE CONSORTIUM ROUTE SELECTIONPROMOTION OF RURAL MUSEUMS AND HERITAGE SITES IN THE VICINITY OF EUROPEAN PILGRIMAGE ROUTES;APUKE O., 2020, HUMANITIES SOCIAL SCIENCES REVIEWS, V8, P318, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.18510/HSSR.2020.8236;BACCOURI N., DEEP-TRANSLATOR 1.11.4;BANKO M., 2020, P 4 WORKSH ONL AB HA, P125, DOI DOI 10.18653/V1/2020.ALW-1.16;BAPTISTA J P., 2022, ENCYCLOPEDIA, V2, P632, DOI DOI 10.3390/ENCYCLOPEDIA2010043;BENJELLOUN R., 2020, ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH, V4, P10;BERREBI C, 2021, VICTIMS OFFENDERS, V16, P99, DOI 10.1080/15564886.2020.1787281;BHAVEEASHESHWAR E., 2023, INNOVATIONS IN BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIONS IN BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS (IBICA 2022).

Concerns regarding the possible detrimental effects of fake news on the public's knowledge of events and topics, as well as on democracy and public discourse in general, have arisen as a result of the rise of social networks. This article aims to provide a summary of a scientific investigation of antisocial behavior from historical research, conceptual analysis, and qualitative research in the form of a case study method. With the aim of analyzing online forums and the concept of disinformation using fake news, its implications have consequences that provoke reflection on this phenomenon. In the results, we propose a framework for investigating and evaluating the concepts of fake news and its interaction with other forms of antisocial behavior, including whether we can achieve satisfactory results with a reduced amount of searched text.

We introduce a novel dataset-Political Popularity Campaign-which comprises social media posts, engagement metrics, and multimedia content from the electoral period. By applying predictive modeling, we estimate key indicators such as post popularity and assess their influence on campaign outcomes. Our findings highlight the significance of micro-targeting practices, the role of algorithmic biases, and the risks associated with disinformation in shaping public opinion. Moreover, this research contributes to the broader discussion on regulating digital campaigning by providing analytical models that can aid policymakers and public authorities in monitoring election compliance and transparency. The study underscores the necessity for robust frameworks to balance the advantages of digital political engagement with the challenges of ensuring fair democratic processes.",Analyzing Digital Political Campaigning Through Machine Learning: An Exploratory Study for the Italian Campaign for European Union Parliament Election in 2024,political analysis; data analytics; machine learning; social media; digital campaigning,UNIVERSITY OF MACERATA;UNIVERSITY OF MACERATA,UNIV MACERATA,NA,"SERNANI P, 2025, COMPUTERS","SERNANI P, 2025, COMPUTERS"

Blocking such deceptive social media spam is essential. However, extracting relevant features from social networks is challenging due to privacy and time constraints. Traditional frequency-based word representation techniques are time-consuming and inefficient in producing contextual word vectors. Word embeddings and deep learning models have recently shown good results in text classification. Also, most existing approaches assumed balanced class distribution, which is false for most real-world datasets. In this paper, an attempt is made to advance the performance of the social spam detection system by leveraging dataset balancing, advanced word embedding techniques, machine learning, and deep learning approaches with the self-attention mechanism. In the proposed framework, the datasets are balanced using NearMiss and SmoteTomek techniques to feed several machine-learning models. Later, the baseline ML models and proposed voting-based ensemble models are evaluated on imbalanced and balanced datasets. For the proposed deep learning-based hybrid approaches, embeddings are generated using GloVe and FastText word embeddings on the balanced combined dataset and passed into the deep neural network comprised of Conv1D and Bi-directional recurrent neural network layers with the self-attention mechanism for improved context understanding and effective results. This study examines hybrid approaches for detecting social spam using imbalanced social network data and picks the optimum combination. Besides, Machine learning ensembles, word embeddings, deep learning with hyper-parameter optimization, and a self-attention method are compared thoroughly. Experiments and comparisons with other techniques show that the proposed hybrid framework with deep learning-based approaches achieves better performance.",Hybrid ensemble framework with self-attention mechanism for social spam detection on imbalanced data,Data resampling; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Online Social Network; Self -Attention; Spam,THAPAR INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,THAPAR INST ENGN AND TECHNOL,NA,"RAO SJ, 2023, EXPERT SYST APPL","RAO SJ, 2023, EXPERT SYST APPL"

Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a single domain (e.g., politics). However, correlations exist commonly across multiple news domains, and thus it is promising to simultaneously detect fake news of multiple domains. Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in multi-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling incompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs one single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece. In this paper, we propose a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (M3 FEND) to address these two challenges. We model news pieces from a multi-view perspective, including semantics, emotion, and style. Specifically, we propose a Domain Memory Bank to enrich domain information which could discover potential domain labels based on seen news pieces and model domain characteristics. Then, with enriched domain information as input, a Domain Adapter could adaptively aggregate discriminative information from multiple views for news in various domains. Extensive offline experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of M3 FEND, and online tests verify its superiority in practice.

THIS TYPE OF FALSE INFORMATION FREQUENTLY APPEARS IN AREAS SUCH AS BUSINESS OR POLITICS, AND ITS WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION ON THE INTERNET CAN DISRUPT THE NORMAL SOCIAL ORDER AND CREATE A BIASED NET- WORK ATMOSPHERE, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NORMAL NETWORK ENVIRONMENT. THE EVOLUTION OF FAKE NEWS, FROM EARLY PLAIN TEXT TO COMPLEX IMAGES AND TEXTS, HAS MADE ITS DETECTION MORE DIFFICULT. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE PROPOSE AN ALBERT RESNET50 HYBRID DEEP NEURAL NET- WORK MODEL THAT COMBINES IMPLICIT FEATURES OF BOTH TEXT AND IMAGES FOR DETECTING MULTIMODAL FAKE NEWS. WE TESTED OUR MODEL ON THREE FAKE NEWS DATASETS, AND THE RESULTS SHOWED AN ACCURACY RATE OF 90.51%, 79.87%, AND 92.93%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL MODELS THAT ONLY USE TEXT DATA, OUR MULTIMODAL MODEL CAN BETTER IDENTIFY FAKE NEWS.","JIANG, MINGYUE;JING, CHANG;CHEN, LIMING;WANG, YANG;LIU, SHOUQIANG","BOIDIDOU C, 2014, WWW'14 COMPANION: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB, P743, DOI 10.1145/2567948.2579323;CHRISTINA B., 2015, MEDIAEVAL BENCHMARK;DEVLIN J, 2019, 2019 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES (NAACL HLT 2019), VOL. 1, P4171;DHAWAN M, 2022, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2202.12478;GUO B, 2019, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1909.03654;HANSELOWSKI A, 2018, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1806.05180;HE HANSEN, 2020, JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, V40, P2189, DOI 10.11772/J.ISSN.1001-9081.2019122114;JIN ZW, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE (MM'17), P795, DOI 10.1145/3123266.3123454;JIN ZW, 2016, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, P2972;JIN ZW, 2017, IEEE T MULTIMEDIA, V19, P598, DOI 10.1109/TMM.2016.2617078;KAI SHU, 2017, ACM SIGKDD EXPLORATIONS NEWSLETTER, V19, P22, DOI 10.1145/3140000/3137600/P22-SHU.PDF?IP130.154.51.250ID3137600ACCACTIVESERVICEKEYD0E502E9DB58724B%2ED0E502E9DB58724B%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35ACM1574437822EEFA2EBA66D50EDD43420A4520C64505, DOI 10.1145/3140000/3137600/P22-SHU.PDF?IP130.154.51.250ID3137600ACCACTIVESERVICEKEYD0E502E9DB58724B%2ED0E502E9DB58724B%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35ACM1574437822EEFA2EBA66D50EDD43420A4520C64505;KHATTAR D, 2019, WEB CONFERENCE 2019: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW 2019), P2915, DOI 10.1145/3308558.3313552;LAN Z., 2020, ICLR;LI QZ, 2019, 57TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2019), P1173;LIU Z, 2021, 2021 IEEE/CVF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV 2021), P9992, DOI 10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00986;MAYANK M, 2021, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2107.10648;MCCLOSKEY S, 2018, ARXIV, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1812.08247;QI P, 2019, IEEE DATA MINING, P518, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2019.00062;SHENGYUN SUN, 2013, WEB TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS. 15TH ASIA-PACIFIC WEB CONFERENCE, APWEB 2013.

This type of false information frequently appears in areas such as business or politics, and its widespread dissemination on the internet can disrupt the normal social order and create a biased net- work atmosphere, ultimately leading to the destruction of the normal network environment. The evolution of fake news, from early plain text to complex images and texts, has made its detection more difficult. To address this, we propose an Albert ResNet50 hybrid deep neural net- work model that combines implicit features of both text and images for detecting multimodal fake news. We tested our model on three fake news datasets, and the results showed an accuracy rate of 90.51%, 79.87%, and 92.93%, respectively. Compared to traditional models that only use text data, our multimodal model can better identify fake news.",An application study on multimodal fake news detection based on Albert-ResNet50 Model,Fake news; Multimodal; Albert; ResNet50; Pre-trained model,GUANGDONG UNIVERSITY OF FOREIGN STUDIES,CHINA NORMAL UNIV NANHAI,NA,"JIANG MY, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL","JIANG MY, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL"

This paper proposes an entropy-based incentive mechanism to diminish the negative effect of malicious behaviors on a quorum-based fake news prevention system. In order to maintain the Safety and Liveness of our system, we employed entropy to measure the degree of voting disagreement to determine appropriate rewards and penalties. To the best of our knowledge, we believe this is the first proposed work to leverage entropy in a fake news prevention system. Moreover, we use Hyperledger Fabric, Schnorr signatures, and human appraisers to implement a practical prototype of a quorum-based fake news prevention system. Then we conduct necessary case analyses and experiments to realize how dishonest participants, crash failures, and scale impact our system. The outcomes of the case analyses and experiments show that our mechanisms are feasible and provide an analytical basis for developing fake news prevention systems.

This issue is particularly important in the digital age, where misinformation can impact society and politics. To address this, we developed ""BiL-FaND,"" an ensemble-based system integrating multiple models designed to analyze distinct aspects of news content. The system employed Multilingual BERT for textual analysis, LSTM models for categorical and numerical data processing, and a caption-generating model using ResNet-101 and GRU for multimedia content analysis. This diverse methodological approach was key in handling the complexity and nuances of multilingual fake news. Our findings were significant, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The textual analysis layer achieved 87% accuracy, indicating strong linguistic analysis performance. The LSTM models for categorical and numerical data showed excellent accuracies of 97% and 94%, respectively, highlighting their capability in pattern recognition and data interpretation. The multimedia layer further augmented our system's accuracy, as evidenced by BLEU scores of 0.82 for English and 0.75 for Urdu captions, with an accuracy of 92%, calculated based on cosine similarity. These results concluded that our multi-layered, ensemble approach was highly effective in the bilingual fake news detection domain and achieved an overall accuracy of 92.07%.",BiL-FaND: leveraging ensemble technique for efficient bilingual fake news detection,Bilingual fake news detection; Ensemble-based system; Multilingual BERT (mBERT); LSTM models; ResNet-101; GRU mechanism; Multimedia content analysis,NATL UNIV COMP AND EMERGING SCI,NATL UNIV COMP AND EMERGING SCI,NA,"MUNIR S, 2024, INT J MACH LEARN CYB","MUNIR S, 2024, INT J MACH LEARN CYB"

Social media and modern technology have facilitated the rapid dissemination of fake news, predominantly in multimedia formats. Despite advancements, multimodal fake news detection models struggle to achieve optimal accuracy, primarily due to the quality of feature representation. This study aims to enhance feature representation to improve fake news identification. Pre-trained models for feature extraction, typically designed for general public domains, may not suit the specific characteristics of our task using the Fakeddit dataset. We propose a localized fine-tuning strategy, refining pre-trained BERT and VGG-19 models for accurate multimodal feature representation in fake news detection. BERT was fine-tuned by retraining all layers, while only the last block of VGG-19 was fine-tuned. To further enhance the representations, we made structural modifications to VGG-19, including the use of a global average pooling layer and a redesigned classifier. This approach significantly improved our multimodal fake news detection model's performance, achieving a high accuracy of 92%. Compared to state-of-the-art studies that use generic pre-trained models, our model demonstrates superior performance. Our research underscores the importance of feature representation in multimodal contexts and opens avenues for exploring the synergy between textual and visual modalities in fake news detection.",Enhanced Feature Representation for Multimodal Fake News Detection Using Localized Fine-Tuning of Improved BERT and VGG-19 Models,Fake news detection; Image-based features; Multimodal feature representation; Fine-tuning; Pre-trained models,UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA;UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,UNIV KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA,NA,"HAMED SK, 2025, ARAB J SCI ENG","HAMED SK, 2025, ARAB J SCI ENG"

MANUAL VERIFICATION OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ONLINE INFORMATION HAS PROVEN TO BE A DAUNTING TASK, WHICH HAS LED TO THE GROWING INTEREST IN AUTOMATIC FAKE NEWS DETECTION. SOME METHODS THAT RELY ON NEWS TEXT, IMAGES, EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE, SOCIAL CONTEXTS, OR PROPAGATION GRAPHS HAVE DEMONSTRATED GOOD PERFORMANCE. IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER STUDIES THAT FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE UNIMODAL NEWS TEXTUAL INFORMATION, RECENT WORKS HAVE INTEGRATED MULTIMODAL FEATURES FROM VARIOUS GRANULARITIES, SUCH AS WORDS, VISUAL SEMANTIC REGIONS, AND MULTIMODAL ENTITIES, TO MORE EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE NEWS CONTENT AND ALIGN WITH HUMAN READING HABITS. HOWEVER, A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF MULTIMODAL FAKE NEWS DETECTION (MFND) IS STILL LACKING, PROMPTING OUR AIM TO COMPLEMENT THIS TOPIC. SPECIFICALLY, WE PRESENT A SYSTEMATIC TAXONOMY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CROSS-MODAL INTERACTIONS. WE CATEGORIZE EXISTING METHODS INTO THE DATA-BASED, ENTITY-BASED, AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED APPROACHES. CONNECTIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS WORKS ARE DETAILED WHEN OUTLINING REPRESENTATIVE PAPERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE INTRODUCE PREVALENT MULTIMODAL LEARNING METHODS, PRESENT ACCESSIBLE MFND DATASETS AND EVALUATION METRICS, AND ANALYZE CURRENT RESEARCH RESULTS.

Manual verification of the massive amount of online information has proven to be a daunting task, which has led to the growing interest in automatic fake news detection. Some methods that rely on news text, images, external knowledge, social contexts, or propagation graphs have demonstrated good performance. In contrast to earlier studies that focused solely on the unimodal news textual information, recent works have integrated multimodal features from various granularities, such as words, visual semantic regions, and multimodal entities, to more effectively leverage news content and align with human reading habits. However, a comprehensive review of Multimodal Fake News Detection (MFND) is still lacking, prompting our aim to complement this topic. Specifically, we present a systematic taxonomy from the perspective of cross-modal interactions. We categorize existing methods into the data-based, entity-based, and knowledge-based approaches. Connections between various works are detailed when outlining representative papers. Additionally, we introduce prevalent multimodal learning methods, present accessible MFND datasets and evaluation metrics, and analyze current research results. Finally, the promising future research directions are discussed.",A Survey of Multimodal Fake News Detection: A Cross-Modal Interaction Perspective,Fake news; Social networking (online); Semantics; Knowledge based systems; Feature extraction; Taxonomy; Surveys; Data mining; Translation; Training; Social networks; multimodal fake news detection; multimodal rumor detection,NORTHWESTERN POLYTECHNICAL UNIVERSITY;NORTHWESTERN POLYTECHNICAL UNIVERSITY,NORTHWESTERN POLYTECH UNIV,NA,"LI XH, 2025, IEEE T EM TOP COMP I","LI XH, 2025, IEEE T EM TOP COMP I"

With a focus on the USA 2020 presidential election, a total of 1,349,373 original Tweets have been collected by our server in real-time from the beginning of April 2020 to the end of January 2021, using four keywords: Trump, Biden, Democrats, and Republicans. In this work, deep learning, natural language processing, geographical information systems, and statistical tools are used to geographically visualize and discover if the political misinformation and extremism, political affiliation, and topics of conversations on social media are correlated with the USA 2020 presidential election results. To this end, a deep neural network is trained using 40,000 manually classified Tweets and further used to automatically classify the entire set of Tweets based on their political affiliation, topic, and whether or not they contain misinformation or extremism. It is shown that, there is a correlation between the aforementioned classes of Tweets and the election results. In other words, the political affiliation of topics and the extent of misinformation and extremism on social media are correlated with the election results to some level. The strongest correlation highlighted that the ratio of Rightist versus Leftist misinformation Tweets has a 0.67 correlation coefficient with the ratio of Trump votes versus Biden votes, across different states.","Geographical visualization of tweets, misinformation, and extremism during the USA 2020 presidential election using LSTM, NLP, and GIS",Misinformation; Elections; Social media; Spatial visualization; Deep learning; Natural language processing,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,GEORGE MASON UNIV,NA,"HASHEMI M, 2023, J BIG DATA-GER","HASHEMI M, 2023, J BIG DATA-GER"

THE DEPENDENCE ON SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE BECOMING MURKIER RAISES THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING DECEIVED AND THE POSSIBILITY OF MISGUIDED AGENDAS. WHEN IT COMES TO VERIFYING ARTICLES, TRADITIONAL NEWS OUTLETS ADHERE TO STRINGENT NORMS OF PRACTICE. IN CONTRAST, PEOPLE NOWADAYS ARE ABLE TO PUBLISH NEWS ITEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND UNVERIFIED SITES WITHOUT HAVING TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE TRUE. BECAUSE THERE ARE NOW NO INDICATORS ON THE INTERNET THAT CAN BE USED TO GAUGE THE VERACITY OF SUCH NEWS PIECES, AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY THAT MAKES USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE REALNESS QUOTIENT OF UNCONFIRMED NEWS ITEMS.

The dependence on sources of information that are becoming murkier raises the likelihood of being deceived and the possibility of misguided agendas. When it comes to verifying articles, traditional news outlets adhere to stringent norms of practice. In contrast, people nowadays are able to publish news items on social media and unverified sites without having to provide evidence that they are true. Because there are now no indicators on the Internet that can be used to gauge the veracity of such news pieces, an innovative strategy that makes use of technology is required in order to evaluate the realness quotient of unconfirmed news items. This paper proposes a dynamic model with a secure voting mechanism that allows news reviewers to submit news input. A probabilistic mathematical model is utilised to estimate the news item's veracity based on the feedback obtained from the news reviewers. In order to guarantee that the information being spread is accurate, the concept, which is based on blockchain technology, will be presented.",The Role of Blockchain to Reduce the Dissemination of Fake News on Social Media and Messaging Platforms,Blockchain; Fake news; Social media; Messaging platforms; Deep Learning (DL); Natural Language Processing (NLP),NORTHUMBRIA UNIVERSITY,NORTHUMBRIA UNIV,NA,"ARANDA-TYRANKIEWICZ M, 2023, ADV SCI TECH SEC APP","ARANDA-TYRANKIEWICZ M, 2023, ADV SCI TECH SEC APP"

With content-based text classification, the topic of a document (politics, sports, health) or fake news is detected. On the other hand, Style-based text classification is used to detect the gender or age of an author, author identification, and authorship attribution. In style-based classification, the set of words defines the author's vocabulary, which contains several hundred words. In this work, the words are known as dimensions. Texts generate high-dimensional vectors. Multiple works have shown that a large number of dimensions decreases the performance of classifiers. To reduce dimensions there are selection and extraction techniques. This article discusses the use of extraction techniques, which create low-dimensional vectors from combinations of the high-dimensional vector. Due to the development of Deep Learning networks, the use of dimension reduction techniques has decreased because these networks perform dimension reduction automatically. However, in Machine Learning such techniques are still used intensively. Motivated by the above, in this paper, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) dimension reduction algorithms are proposed for the identification of texts written by 14 authors of the Corpus PAN 2012. The texts were divided into sequences of 10, 20, and 30 words called sentences. Likewise, blocks of texts made up of 100 sentences were created. The supervised classification was performed with the Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms using the accuracy metric. The results showed that the reduction of dimensions with PCA and the LR and SVM classifiers achieved better results than other similar works of the state of the art using the same corpus.",Evaluation of Feature Extraction Techniques in Automatic Authorship Attribution,Dimension reduction; feature extraction; authorship attribution; machine learning,INSTITUTO POLITECNICO NACIONAL - MEXICO,G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"R√çOS-TOLEDO G, 2023, COMPUT SIST","R√çOS-TOLEDO G, 2023, COMPUT SIST"

This study addresses this critical issue by advancing fake news detection in Arabic and overcoming limitations in existing approaches. Deep learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), EfficientNetB4, Inception, Xception, ResNet, ConvLSTM and a novel voting ensemble framework combining CNN and LSTM are employed for text classification. The proposed framework integrates the ELMO word embedding technique having contextual representation capabilities, which is compared with GloVe, BERT, FastText and FastText subwords. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed voting ensemble, combined with ELMo word embeddings, consistently outperforms previous approaches. It achieves an accuracy of 98.42%, precision of 98.54%, recall of 99.5%, and an F1 score of 98.93%, offering an efficient and highly effective solution for text classification tasks.The proposed framework benchmark against state-of-the-art transformer architectures, including BERT and RoBERTa, demonstrates competitive performance with significantly reduced inference time and enhanced interpretability accompanied by a 5-fold cross-validation technique. Furthermore, this research utilizes the LIME XAI technique to provide deeper insights into the contribution of each feature in predicting a specific target class. These findings show the proposed framework's effectiveness in dealing with the issues of detecting false news, particularly in Arabic text. By generating higher performance metrics and displaying comparable results, this work opens the way for more reliable and interpretable text classification solutions.",Novel approach for Arabic fake news classification using embedding from large language features with CNN-LSTM ensemble model and explainable AI,NA,UNIVERSITY OF JEDDAH;ISLAMIA UNIVERSITY OF BAHAWALPUR,ISLAMIA UNIV BAHAWALPUR,NA,"ABOULOLA OI, 2024, SCI REP-UK","ABOULOLA OI, 2024, SCI REP-UK"

HOWEVER, NEWS POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA OFTEN INCLUDE DIVERSE MODALITIES, E.G., TEXT, IMAGE, ETC., AND DIVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO POLITICS, ECONOMICS, ETC., RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT MODALITY AND EVENT DIFFERENCES. HOW TO JOINTLY LEARN MODAL-INVARIANT AND EVENT-INVARIANT DISCRIMINATIVE FEATURES EFFECTIVELY OF NEWS POSTS REMAINS A CHALLENGE. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL FND APPROACH, CALLED CYCLE MAPPING AND ADVERSARIAL EVENT CLASSIFICATION NETWORK (CMAECN). IT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS: A MULTI-MODAL CYCLE FEATURE MAPPING MODULE (CMM) AND AN ADVERSARIAL EVENT CLASSIFICATION MODULE (AECM). IN ORDER TO FULLY REDUCE MODALITY DIFFERENCE, THE CMM MODULE IS DESIGNED, WHICH PERFORMS CROSS-MODAL GENERATION BETWEEN IMAGE AND TEXT MODALITIES BY USING THE GENERATIVE MODEL, CONDUCTS FEATURE SOURCE IDENTIFICATION BETWEEN INITIAL AND GENERATED FEATURES FOR EACH MODALITY WITH THE DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL, AND RECONSTRUCTS TEXT OR IMAGE FEATURES WITH THE CROSS-MODAL FUSED FEATURES TO AVOID INFORMATION LOSS WITH THE RECONSTRUCTOR. IN ORDER TO FULLY REDUCE EVENT DIFFERENCE, THE AECM MODULE IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM EVENT ADVERSARIAL CLASSIFICATION BETWEEN THE EVENT CLASSIFICATION TASK AND THE EVENT-INDEPENDENT CLASSIFICATION TASK WITH A MULTI-TASK EVENT CLASSIFIER, WHERE EACH DIMENSION OF THE CLASSIFIER OUTPUT CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN EVENT CATEGORY, AND AN ADDITIONAL DIMENSION OF THE OUTPUT REPRESENTS THE EVENT-INDEPENDENT CATEGORY.

However, news posts on social media often include diverse modalities, e.g., text, image, etc., and diverse events related to politics, economics, etc., resulting in significant modality and event differences. How to jointly learn modal-invariant and event-invariant discriminative features effectively of news posts remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel FND approach, called Cycle Mapping and Adversarial Event Classification Network (CMAECN). It consists of two parts: a multi-modal cycle feature mapping module (CMM) and an adversarial event classification module (AECM). In order to fully reduce modality difference, the CMM module is designed, which performs cross-modal generation between image and text modalities by using the generative model, conducts feature source identification between initial and generated features for each modality with the discriminative model, and reconstructs text or image features with the cross-modal fused features to avoid information loss with the reconstructor. In order to fully reduce event difference, the AECM module is designed to perform event adversarial classification between the event classification task and the event-independent classification task with a multi-task event classifier, where each dimension of the classifier output corresponds to a certain event category, and an additional dimension of the output represents the event-independent category. The network training of CMAECN is conducted by adopting an adversarial scheme. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and CMAECN shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art multi-modal FND methods.",Cycle mapping with adversarial event classification network for fake news detection,Modality differences; Event differences; Cycle mapping; Adversarial event classification; Fake news detection,NANJING UNIVERSITY OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS;NANJING UNIVERSITY OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS;WUHAN UNIVERSITY,NANJING UNIV POSTS AND TELECOMMUN,NA,"WU F, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL","WU F, 2024, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL"

In this article, we introduce a veracity dataset of Arabic tweets called ""VERA-ARAB"", a pioneering large-scale dataset designed to enhance fake news detection in Arabic tweets. VERA-ARAB is a balanced, multi-domain, and multidialectal dataset, containing both fake and true news, meticulously verified by factchecking experts from Misbar. Comprising approximately 20,000 tweets from 13,000 distinct users and covering 884 different claims, the dataset includes detailed information such as news text, user details, and spatiotemporal data, spanning diverse domains like sports and politics. We leveraged the X API to retrieve and structure the dataset, providing a comprehensive data dictionary to describe the raw data and conducting a thorough statistical descriptive analysis. This analysis reveals insightful patterns and distributions, visualized according to data type and nature. We also evaluated the dataset using multiple machine learning classification models, exploring various social and textual features. Our findings indicate promising results, particularly with textual features, underscoring the dataset's potential for enhancing fake news detection. Furthermore, we outline future work aimed at expanding VERA-ARAB to establish it as a benchmark for Arabic tweets in fake news detection. We also discuss other potential applications that could leverage the VERA-ARAB dataset, emphasizing its value and versatility for advancing the field of fake news detection in Arabic social media. Potential applications include user veracity assessment, topic modeling, and named entity recognition, demonstrating the dataset's wide-ranging utility for broader research in information quality management on social media.",VERA-ARAB: unveiling the Arabic tweets credibility by constructing balanced news dataset for veracity analysis,Social computing; Social media; Fake news; Arabic dataset; Topic classification; Named entity recognition,KING SAUD UNIVERSITY;KING SAUD UNIVERSITY,KING SAUD UNIV;KING SAUD UNIV,NA,"MOSTAFA MA, 2024, PEERJ COMPUT SCI","MOSTAFA MA, 2024, PEERJ COMPUT SCI"

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SYSTEMS COULD AFFECT DEMOCRACY THROUGH URBAN SPACE, FOR EXAMPLE, BY BREACHING DATA PRIVACY, HINDERING POLITICAL EQUALITY AND ENGAGEMENT, OR MANIPULATING INFORMATION ABOUT PLACES. THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE URBAN PLACES THAT PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT ACCORDING TO THE OUTPUTS GENERATED WITH CHATGPT-4O. THIS RESEARCH MOVES BEYOND THE DOMINANT FRAMEWORK OF DISCUSSIONS ON AI AND DEMOCRACY AS A FORM OF SPREADING MISINFORMATION AND FAKE NEWS. INSTEAD, IT PROVIDES AN INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORK, COMBINING ARCHITECTURAL SPACE AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE WAY IN WHICH GENERATIVE AI TOOLS PROVIDE A NUANCED VIEW OF DEMOCRACY THAT COULD POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING AI FOR DEMOCRACY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ARCHITECTURE. FOR THE FIRST CASE STUDY IN STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, AI OUTPUTS WERE LATER COMBINED WITH GIS MAPS AND A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. THE RESEARCH THEN ANALYZES THE RESULTS OBTAINED FOR MADRID, SPAIN, AND BRUSSELS, BELGIUM. THIS ANALYSIS PROVIDES DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO THE OUTPUTS OBTAINED WITH AI, THE PLACES THAT FACILITATE DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AND THOSE THAT ARE OVERLOOKED, AND THE ENSUING CONSEQUENCES.RESULTS SHOW THAT URBAN SPACE FOR DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT OBTAINED WITH CHATGPT-4O FOR STOCKHOLM IS MAINLY COMPOSED OF GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR REPRESENTATIVE OR DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE EDUCATION OF INDIVIDUALS IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN THE CITY CENTRE. THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH CHATGPT-40 BARELY REFLECT PUBLIC OPEN SPACES, PARKS, OR ROUTES. THEY ALSO PRIORITIZE ORGANIZED RATHER THAN SPONTANEOUS ENGAGEMENT AND DO NOT REFLECT UNSTRUCTURED EVENTS LIKE DEMONSTRATIONS, AND POWERFUL ACTORS, SUCH AS POLITICAL PARTIES, OR WORKERS' UNIONS. THE PLACES LISTED BY CHATGPT-4O FOR MADRID AND BRUSSELS GIVE MAJOR PROMINENCE TO PRIVATE SPACES LIKE OFFICES THAT HOUSE ORGANIZATIONS WITH POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. WHILE CITIES OFFER A BROAD AND COMPLEX ARRAY OF PLACES FOR DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT, OUTPUTS OBTAINED WITH AI CAN NARROW USERS' PERSPECTIVES ON THEIR REAL OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE PERPETUATING POWERFUL AGENTS BY NOT MAKING THEM SUFFICIENTLY VISIBLE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. IN CONCLUSION, URBAN SPACE IS A FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DEMOCRACY, AND AI OUTPUTS COULD BE A VALID STARTING POINT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PLETHORA OF INTERACTIONS. THESE OUTPUTS SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTED WITH OTHER FORMS OF KNOWLEDGE TO PRODUCE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK THAT ADJUSTS TO REALITY FOR DEVELOPING AI IN A DEMOCRATIC CONTEXT.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could affect democracy through urban space, for example, by breaching data privacy, hindering political equality and engagement, or manipulating information about places. This research explores the urban places that promote democratic engagement according to the outputs generated with ChatGPT-4o. This research moves beyond the dominant framework of discussions on AI and democracy as a form of spreading misinformation and fake news. Instead, it provides an innovative framework, combining architectural space as an infrastructure for democracy and the way in which generative AI tools provide a nuanced view of democracy that could potentially influence millions of people. This article presents a new conceptual framework for understanding AI for democracy from the perspective of architecture. For the first case study in Stockholm, Sweden, AI outputs were later combined with GIS maps and a theoretical framework. The research then analyzes the results obtained for Madrid, Spain, and Brussels, Belgium. This analysis provides deeper insights into the outputs obtained with AI, the places that facilitate democratic engagement and those that are overlooked, and the ensuing consequences.Results show that urban space for democratic engagement obtained with ChatGPT-4o for Stockholm is mainly composed of governmental institutions and non-governmental organizations for representative or deliberative democracy and the education of individuals in public buildings in the city centre. The results obtained with ChatGPT-40 barely reflect public open spaces, parks, or routes. They also prioritize organized rather than spontaneous engagement and do not reflect unstructured events like demonstrations, and powerful actors, such as political parties, or workers' unions. The places listed by ChatGPT-4o for Madrid and Brussels give major prominence to private spaces like offices that house organizations with political activities. While cities offer a broad and complex array of places for democratic engagement, outputs obtained with AI can narrow users' perspectives on their real opportunities, while perpetuating powerful agents by not making them sufficiently visible to be accountable for their actions. In conclusion, urban space is a fundamental infrastructure for democracy, and AI outputs could be a valid starting point for understanding the plethora of interactions. These outputs should be complemented with other forms of knowledge to produce a more comprehensive framework that adjusts to reality for developing AI in a democratic context. Urban space should be protected as a shared space and as an asset for societies to fully develop democracy in its multiple forms. Democracy and urban spaces influence each other and are subject to pressures from different actors including AI. AI systems should, therefore, be monitored to enhance democratic values through urban space.",Spaces for democracy with generative artificial intelligence: public architecture at stake,Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Democracy; Public space; ChatGPT; Urban space,ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,KTH SCH ARCHITECTURE,NA,"CAMPO-RUIZ I, 2025, AI SOC","CAMPO-RUIZ I, 2025, AI SOC"

IN RECENT YEARS, THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (SMPS) HAS PROVIDED A RICH SOURCE OF DATA FOR ANALYZING PUBLIC OPINIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ELECTION-RELATED CONVERSATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF ELECTION-RELATED TWEETS PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES DUE TO THE COMPLEX LANGUAGE USED, INCLUDING FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS, SARCASM, AND THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THIS PAPER PROPOSES ELECTION-FOCUSED BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (ELECBERT), A NEW MODEL FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN THE CONTEXT OF ELECTION-RELATED TWEETS. ELECTION-RELATED TWEETS POSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS DUE TO THEIR COMPLEX LANGUAGE, SARCASM, AND MISINFORMATION. ELECBERT IS BASED ON THE BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATIONS FROM TRANSFORMERS (BERT) LANGUAGE MODEL AND IS FINE-TUNED ON TWO DATASETS: ELECTION-RELATED SENTIMENT-ANNOTATED TWEETS (ELECSENT)-MULTI-LANGUAGES, CONTAINING 5.31 MILLION LABELED TWEETS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES, AND ELECSENT-ENGLISH, CONTAINING 4.75 MILLION LABELED TWEETS IN ENGLISH. THE MODEL OUTPERFORMS OTHER MACHINE LEARNING MODELS SUCH AS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM), NAIVE BAYES (NB), AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST), WITH AN ACCURACY OF 0.9905 AND F1-SCORE OF 0.9816 ON ELECSENT-MULTI-LANGUAGES, AND AN ACCURACY OF 0.9930 AND F1-SCORE OF 0.9899 ON ELECSENT-ENGLISH.

In recent years, the rise of social media platforms (SMPs) has provided a rich source of data for analyzing public opinions, particularly in the context of election-related conversations. Nevertheless, sentiment analysis of election-related tweets presents unique challenges due to the complex language used, including figurative expressions, sarcasm, and the spread of misinformation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Election-focused Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (ElecBERT), a new model for sentiment analysis in the context of election-related tweets. Election-related tweets pose unique challenges for sentiment analysis due to their complex language, sarcasm, and misinformation. ElecBERT is based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model and is fine-tuned on two datasets: Election-Related Sentiment-Annotated Tweets (ElecSent)-Multi-Languages, containing 5.31 million labeled tweets in multiple languages, and ElecSent-English, containing 4.75 million labeled tweets in English. The model outperforms other machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with an accuracy of 0.9905 and F1-score of 0.9816 on ElecSent-Multi-Languages, and an accuracy of 0.9930 and F1-score of 0.9899 on ElecSent-English. The performance of different models was compared using the 2020 United States (US) Presidential Election as a case study. The ElecBERT-English and ElecBERT-Multi-Languages models outperformed BERTweet, with the ElecBERT-English model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.13. This paper presents a valuable contribution to sentiment analysis in the context of election-related tweets, with potential applications in political analysis, social media management, and policymaking.",Improving Sentiment Analysis in Election-Based Conversations on Twitter with ElecBERT Language Model,Sentiment analysis; social media; election prediction; machine learning; transformers,BEIJING INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,SCH COMP SCI AND TECHNOL,NA,"KHAN A, 2023, CMC-COMPUT MATER CON","KHAN A, 2023, CMC-COMPUT MATER CON"

Unfortunately, this accessibility has also facilitated the rapid dissemination of misinformation, irrespective of its credibility, particularly over the past decade. Misinformation spreaders take advantage of serious situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic, to spread false information. While numerous studies have focused on detecting misinformation in the English language, research in Urdu language misinformation detection remains limited. Our contribution to this field is twofold: firstly, we have compiled a substantial and diverse dataset of Urdu tweets. Secondly, we have introduced a novel approach incorporating feature extraction and ensemble learning techniques, complemented by high-performance filtering and voting classifiers designed explicitly for the COVID-19 Urdu dataset. The research paper employs a BERT-based transfer learning approach for feature extraction, followed by machine learning and ensemble methods for adequate classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, this paper conducted a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model for detecting misinformation surpassed existing approaches when applied to the COVID-19 Twitter Urdu Tweets dataset, achieving an impressive F1 score of 0.93 and an accuracy of 0.92.

WITH THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, THE PUBLIC USES THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS. SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE BEEN USED FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND ELECTION ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY TWITTER. THE RESEARCHERS INTEND TO PREDICT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS BY ANALYZING THE PUBLIC STANCE TOWARD THE CANDIDATES USING TWITTER DATA. PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN FINDING A MODEL THAT SIMULATES WELL THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SYSTEM. THIS MANUSCRIPT PROPOSES AN EFFICIENT MODEL THAT PREDICTS THE 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FROM GEO-LOCATED TWEETS BY LEVERAGING THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS POTENTIAL, MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER, AND MACHINE LEARNING. AN EXTENSIVE STUDY IS PERFORMED FOR ALL 50 STATES TO PREDICT THE 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS LED BY THE STATE-BASED PUBLIC STANCE FOR ELECTORAL VOTES. THE GENERAL PUBLIC STANCE IS ALSO PREDICTED FOR POPULAR VOTES. THE TRUE PUBLIC STANCE IS PRESERVED BY ELIMINATING ALL OUTLIERS AND REMOVING SUSPICIOUS TWEETS GENERATED BY BOTS AND AGENTS RECRUITED FOR MANIPULATING THE ELECTION. THE PRE-ELECTION AND POST-ELECTION PUBLIC STANCES ARE ALSO STUDIED WITH THEIR TIME AND SPACE VARIATIONS. THE INFLUENCERS' EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC STANCE WAS DISCUSSED. NETWORK ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION TECHNIQUES WERE PERFORMED TO DETECT ANY HIDDEN PATTERNS.

With the growing importance of social media, the public uses them to express their thoughts and communicate with others. Social media have been used for political campaigns and election activities, especially Twitter. The researchers intend to predict presidential election results by analyzing the public stance toward the candidates using Twitter data. Previous researchers have not succeeded in finding a model that simulates well the U.S. presidential election system. This manuscript proposes an efficient model that predicts the 2020 U.S. presidential election from geo-located tweets by leveraging the sentiment analysis potential, multinomial naive Bayes classifier, and machine learning. An extensive study is performed for all 50 states to predict the 2020 U.S. presidential election results led by the state-based public stance for electoral votes. The general public stance is also predicted for popular votes. The true public stance is preserved by eliminating all outliers and removing suspicious tweets generated by bots and agents recruited for manipulating the election. The pre-election and post-election public stances are also studied with their time and space variations. The influencers' effect on the public stance was discussed. Network analysis and community detection techniques were performed to detect any hidden patterns. An algorithm-defined stance meter decision rule was introduced to predict Joe Biden as the President-elect. The model's effectiveness in predicting the election results for each state was validated by the comparison of the predicted results with the actual election results. With a percentage of 89.9%, the proposed model showed that Joe Biden dominated the electoral college and became the winner of the U.S. presidential election in 2020.",280 characters to the White House: predicting 2020 US presidential elections from twitter data,Social cybersecurity; Network analysis; Social media analytics; Sentiment analysis; Elections; Misinformation; Fake news,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA;UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA LAFAYETTE,UNIV SOUTH DAKOTA,NA,"RIZK R, 2023, COMPUT MATH ORGAN TH","RIZK R, 2023, COMPUT MATH ORGAN TH"

[POLLICINO, ORESTE] BOCCONI UNIV, SCH LAW, MILAN, ITALY.",ISI,"The spread of disinformation, such as false and fabricated content, as amplified by the expansion of artificial intelligence systems, has captured the attention of policymakers on a global scale. However, addressing disinformation leads constitutional democracies towards questions about the scope of freedom of expression as the living core of a democratic society. If, on the one hand, this constitutional right has been considered a barrier to public authorities' interferences to limit the circulation of disinformation, on the other hand, the spread of fabricated content and manipulative techniques, including deepfakes, has increasingly questioned liberal views. This constitutional challenge is further enriched by the role of online platforms which, by mediating speech in their online spaces, are essential tiles of a mosaic picturing the potential regulatory strategies and the limit of public enforcement to tackle disinformation. Within this framework, this work argues that the European constitutional approach to tackle disinformation has defined a unique model on a global scale. The European Union has developed a strategy that combines procedural safeguards, risk regulation, and co-regulation, as demonstrated by initiatives such as the Digital Services Act, the Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation, and the Artificial Intelligence Act. Positioned between liberal and illiberal models, the European approach proposes an alternative constitutional vision to address disinformation based on risk mitigation and the collaboration between public and private actors.",The European Constitutional Way to Address Disinformation in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,Freedom of expression; disinformation; online platforms; artificial intelligence; fundamental rights,UNIVERSIDADE CATOLICA PORTUGUESA;BOCCONI UNIVERSITY,CATOLICA GLOBAL SCH LAW,NA,"DE GREGORIO G, 2025, GERMAN LAW J","DE GREGORIO G, 2025, GERMAN LAW J"

It investigates how AI has been weaponised to manipulate narratives and suggests strategies to counteract disinformation. Drawing on case studies from the Philippines, Taiwan, and India-regions in the Indo-Pacific with vibrant democracies, high digital engagement, and recent experiences with election-related misinformation-it highlights the risks of AI-driven content and the innovative measures used to address its spread. The commentary advocates for a balanced approach that incorporates technological solutions, regulatory frameworks, and digital literacy to safeguard democratic processes and promote informed public participation. The rise of generative AI tools has significantly amplified the risks of disinformation, such as deepfakes, and algorithmic biases. These technologies have been exploited to influence voter perceptions and undermine democratic systems, creating a pressing need for protective measures. In the Philippines, social media platforms have been used to spread revisionist narratives, while Taiwan employs AI for real-time fact-checking. India's proactive approach, including a public misinformation tipline, showcases effective countermeasures. These examples highlight the complex challenges and opportunities presented by AI in different electoral contexts. The commentary stresses the need for regulatory frameworks designed to address AI's dual-use nature, advocating for transparency, real-time monitoring, and collaboration between governments, civil society, and the private sector. It also explores the criteria for effective AI solutions, including scalability, adaptability, and ethical considerations, to guide future interventions. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of digital literacy and resilient information ecosystems in supporting informed democratic participation.",Disinformation by design: leveraging solutions to combat misinformation in the Philippines' 2025 election,AI-driven misinformation; AI ethics; deepfakes; digital autocratisation; digital media literacy; disinformation; electoral integrity; fact-checking; generative AI; historical revisionism; large language models; media regulation; Philippine elections; political campaigns; social media platforms,GERMAN INSTITUTE OF GLOBAL AND AREA STUDIES,SCHIPPER,NA,"SCHIPPER T, 2025, DATA POLICY","SCHIPPER T, 2025, DATA POLICY"

THIS STUDY ANALYZES AND CHARACTERIZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN EMOTIONS AND OTHER ELEMENTS (SOCIAL BOTS AND ECHO CHAMBERS), WHICH ARE MAJOR FACTORS IN THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE OBTAIN FROM X (FORMERLY TWITTER) THE CASE THAT WAS FACT-CHECKED AS DISINFORMATION IN JAPAN AND ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH FACTOR IN A TIME SEQUENCE USING EXISTING TOOLS AND METHODS. AFTER CONFIRMING THE SIMILAR RESULTS TO PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT EMOTIONAL POSTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE SPREAD, OUR ANALYSIS SHOWED THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOCIAL BOTS WERE HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL IN AMPLIFYING NEGATIVE SENTIMENT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF SPREAD. REGARDING EMOTIONS AND ECHO CHAMBERS, WE OBSERVED THAT THE INCREASE IN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND THE FORMATION OF ECHO CHAMBERS FOLLOWED A SIMILAR TIME SEQUENCE. IN ADDITION, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE AMPLIFICATION OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS PRECEDES THE FORMATION OF ECHO CHAMBERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THE IMPORTANCE OF DETECTING SOCIAL BOT ACTIVITY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INFORMATION DIFFUSION AND CONTROLLING THE AMPLIFICATION OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.","IPPA, SHUHEI;OKUBO, TAKAO;HASHIMOTO, MASAKI","ALVAREZ-HAMELIN J., 2005, ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS, V18;ANONYMOUS, HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WORKING GROUP ON THE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW FOURTEENTH SESSION GENEVA, 22 OCTOBER-5 NOVEMBER 2012 'NATIONAL REPORT SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 5 OF THE ANNEX TO HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL RESOLUTION 16/21 GHANA' A/HRC/WG.6/14/GHA/1 10 AUGUST 2012 AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://DOCUMENTS-DDSNY.UN.ORG/DOC/UNDOC/GEN/G12/158/78/PDF/G1215878.PDF?OPENELEMENT ACCESSED 10 JULY 2020.;ANONYMOUS, 2024, LEADING COUNTRIES BASED ON NUMBER OF X (FORMERLY TWITTER) USERS AS OF APRIL 2024;ARGUEDAS A.

This study analyzes and characterizes the relationship between human emotions and other elements (social bots and echo chambers), which are major factors in the spread of information, including disinformation and misinformation. Specifically, we obtain from X (formerly Twitter) the case that was fact-checked as disinformation in Japan and analyze the relationship between each factor in a time sequence using existing tools and methods. After confirming the similar results to previous studies that emotional posts were more likely to be spread, our analysis showed the possibility that social bots were highly influential in amplifying negative sentiment in the early stages of spread. Regarding emotions and echo chambers, we observed that the increase in negative emotions and the formation of echo chambers followed a similar time sequence. In addition, we confirmed that the amplification of negative emotions precedes the formation of echo chambers. The results of this analysis suggested the importance of detecting social bot activity in the early stages of information diffusion and controlling the amplification of negative emotions.",The Relationship Between Emotional and Other Factors in Information Diffusion,Fake news; Voting; Information diffusion; Surveys; Machine learning; Linguistics; Information sharing; Information security; COVID-19; Blogs; Emotion; social bots; echo chamber; disinformation,KAGAWA UNIVERSITY,KAGAWA UNIV,NA,"IPPA S, 2025, IEEE ACCESS","IPPA S, 2025, IEEE ACCESS"

TO TEST THE ROBUSTNESS OF THIS SOCIAL FOOTPRINT, WE TRAIN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO IDENTIFY IT AND CREATE A PREDICTIVE MODEL. WE USE TWITTER DATA IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE NETWORK FOR TRAINING THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND TO TEST THE PREDICTION. OUR MODEL ATTAINS 88% PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR THE TEST SET. TESTING OUR PREDICTION ON TWO ADDITIONAL MODELS RESULTS IN 90.7% AND 90.5% ACCURACY, VALIDATING OUR MODEL.

This was a coordinated effort, part of a Russian-led complex information operation. Utilizing the anonymity and outreach of social media platforms Russian operatives created an online astroturf that is in direct contact with regular Americans, promoting Russian agenda and goals. The elusiveness of this type of adversarial approach rendered security agencies helpless, stressing the unique challenges this type of intervention presents. Building on existing scholarship on the functions within influence networks on social media, we suggest a new approach to map those types of operations. We argue that pretending to be legitimate social actors obliges the network to adhere to social expectations, leaving a social footprint. To test the robustness of this social footprint, we train artificial intelligence to identify it and create a predictive model. We use Twitter data identified as part of the Russian influence network for training the artificial intelligence and to test the prediction. Our model attains 88% prediction accuracy for the test set. Testing our prediction on two additional models results in 90.7% and 90.5% accuracy, validating our model. The predictive and validation results suggest that building a machine learning model around social functions within the Russian influence network can be used to map its actors and functions.",Keeping it authentic: the social footprint of the trolls' network,Astroturf; Social footprint; Artificial intelligence; Predictive model,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM;TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF OHIO;WITTENBERG UNIVERSITY;TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM;TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,WITTENBERG UNIV,NA,"SWED O, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN","SWED O, 2024, SOC NETW ANAL MIN"

SP leverages respondents' metacognition: estimation of the rarity of their opinions among those of all respondents. Since a respondent's metacognition is considered to be shaped by people around them, we can better understand metacognition and SP voting performance by focusing on the structure of social networks. We analyzed the effect of respondents' referring to connected individuals on SP voting performance when they predict other respondents' opinions. We also analyzed the effect of the structure of social networks on respondents' metacognition and on SP voting performance. Simulation experiments using various social networks revealed that respondents' referring to connected individuals is important in SP voting performance and that the structure of social networks plays an important role in respondents' metacognition and SP voting performance. Even if respondents refer to connected individuals, their metacognition can differ from the actual distribution of opinions across all respondents depending on the structure of the social networks, which greatly affects SP voting performance.",Analysis of Surprisingly Popular Voting for Opinion Aggregation on Social Networks,Metacognition; Social networking (online); Focusing; Aggregates; Machine learning; Fake news; Crowdsourcing; Bars; Urban areas; Robots; simulation analysis; social networks; surprisingly popular voting; wisdom of the crowd,SAARLAND UNIVERSITY;NAGOYA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;NAGOYA CITY UNIVERSITY;RIKEN;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (AIST);UNIVERSITY OF TSUKUBA,SAARLAND UNIV,NA,"YAMASHITA Y, 2025, IEEE ACCESS","YAMASHITA Y, 2025, IEEE ACCESS"

The present study conducts a bibliometric analysis of scholarly efforts made over time in the research papers associated with the disinformation field. Thus, this paper aims to understand and help combat disinformation by focusing on methodologies, datasets, and key metadata. Through a bibliometric approach, the study identifies leading authors, affiliations, and journals and examines collaboration networks in the field of disinformation. This analysis highlights the significant growth in research on disinformation, particularly in response to events such as the 2016 U.S. election, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic, with an overall growth rate of 15.14% in the entire analyzed period. The results of the analysis underscore the role of social media and artificial intelligence in the spread of disinformation, as well as the importance of fact-checking technologies. Findings reveal that the most prolific contributions come from universities in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Spain, and other global institutions, with a notable increase in publications since 2018. Through thematic maps, a keyword analysis, and collaboration networks, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving field of disinformation research, offering valuable insights for future investigations and policy development.",Navigating the Disinformation Maze: A Bibliometric Analysis of Scholarly Efforts,disinformation; thematic map; bibliometric analysis; biblioshiny,BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST UNIV ECON STUDIES,NA,"TATARU GC, 2024, INFORMATION","TATARU GC, 2024, INFORMATION"

Deepfakes can be used for many malpractices such as blackmail, politics, social media, etc. These can lead to widespread misinformation and can be harmful to an individual or an institution's reputation. It has become important to be able to identify deepfakes effectively, while there exist many machine learning techniques to identify them, these methods are not able to cope up with the rapidly improving GAN technology which is used to generate deepfakes. Our project aims to identify deepfakes successfully using machine learning along with Heart Rate Analysis. The heart rate identified by our model is unique to each individual and cannot be spoofed or imitated by a GAN and is thus susceptible to improving GAN technology. To solve the deepfake detection problem we employ various machine learning models along with heart rate analysis to detect deepfakes.",AFMB-Net: DeepFake Detection Network Using Heart Rate Analysis,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Celeb-DF; Deepfake; Frame Normalisation; Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN); Motion Magnification Spatio-Temporal Map (MMST Map); MBConv Blocks; PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG),PES UNIVERSITY;PES UNIVERSITY,PES UNIV,NA,"VINAY A, 2022, TEH GLAS","VINAY A, 2022, TEH GLAS"

IT IS QUITE CHALLENGING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF INFORMATION CREDIBILITY FOR MICROBLOGS. IT BECOMES MORE CHALLENGING WHEN THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE POSTER IS HIDDEN. THE CONCEPT OF INFORMATION CREDIBILITY HAS MULTI-PERSPECTIVES. THERE ARE MANY NECESSARY ASPECTS OF INFORMATION CREDIBILITY WHICH MUST BE CONSIDERED FOR EFFECTIVE CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT. IT IS OBSERVED THAT SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF CREDIBILITY ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN EXISTING STUDIES. THE COMPLETE CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT SOLUTION NEEDS A COMPREHENSIVE AND DIVERSE SET OF FEATURES FOR SUCH COMPLEX IDENTIFICATION. THEREFORE, THESE FEATURES ARE IDENTIFIED AND PROPOSED BY EXPLORING THE RELATED RESEARCH STUDIES CONSISTING OF THE NECESSARY CREDIBILITY ASPECTS. THESE FEATURES CONSIST OF DIVERSE LEVELS PROVIDED BY MICROBLOGS. THESE LEVELS INCLUDE THE POST, POSTER, POSTER'S SOCIAL NETWORK, AND ACTUAL INFORMATION PROPAGATION NETWORK. AN EXPLORATORY STUDY IS ALSO CONDUCTED TO PROPOSE THE BEST CREDIBILITY FEATURES THAT ARE USED IN THE PROPOSED SOLUTION. THE ATTEMPT IS MADE FOR A HYBRID FEATURES FUSION MODEL WHICH COMBINES FEATURE-BASED OR MACHINE LEARNING AND GRAPH-BASED APPROACHES. IT IS A LIGHTWEIGHT, HIGH-PERFORMING, NON-LATENT FEATURES MODEL TO AVOID THEIR DRAWBACKS. IT ASSESSES THE LEVELS OF CREDIBILITY OF THE CONCERNED POST. IT IS DESIGNED FOR HIGH-IMPACT APPLICATIONS TO COMBAT LOW-CREDIBILITY CONTENT DURING ELECTIONS, CRISES, AND OTHER CRITICAL SCENARIOS.

It is quite challenging to address the issue of information credibility for microblogs. It becomes more challenging when the authenticity of the poster is hidden. The concept of information credibility has multi-perspectives. There are many necessary aspects of information credibility which must be considered for effective credibility assessment. It is observed that some important aspects of credibility are not considered in existing studies. The complete credibility assessment solution needs a comprehensive and diverse set of features for such complex identification. Therefore, these features are identified and proposed by exploring the related research studies consisting of the necessary credibility aspects. These features consist of diverse levels provided by microblogs. These levels include the post, poster, poster's social network, and actual information propagation network. An exploratory study is also conducted to propose the best credibility features that are used in the proposed solution. The attempt is made for a hybrid features fusion model which combines feature-based or machine learning and graph-based approaches. It is a lightweight, high-performing, non-latent features model to avoid their drawbacks. It assesses the levels of credibility of the concerned post. It is designed for high-impact applications to combat low-credibility content during elections, crises, and other critical scenarios. The model is executed over a publicly available dataset extended for credibility assessment. The model provides good results with 95.6% accuracy by XGBoost using platinum features. The performance of the proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art that produced much-appreciating results.",Tweet Credibility Ranker: A Credibility Features' Fusion Model,Information credibility; Tweet credibility; Credibility features; Credibility model; Microblog credibility framework,AL GHAZALI UNIV,AL GHAZALI UNIV,NA,"QURESHI KA, 2025, COGN COMPUT","QURESHI KA, 2025, COGN COMPUT"

IT IS ALSO A POLICY PROBLEM BECAUSE MISINFORMATION CAN HARM BOTH THE PUBLIC AND DEMOCRACIES. TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION, POLICYMAKERS REQUIRE A SUCCESSFUL INTERFACE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND POLICY, AS WELL AS A RANGE OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WHILE EFFICIENTLY MITIGATING THE HARMS OF MISINFORMATION ONLINE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS HOW REGULATORY AND NONREGULATORY INSTRUMENTS CAN BE INFORMED BY SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND USED TO REACH EU POLICY OBJECTIVES. FIRST, WE CONSIDER WHAT IT MEANS TO APPROACH MISINFORMATION AS A POLICY PROBLEM. WE THEN OUTLINE FOUR BUILDING BLOCKS FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND POLICYMAKERS WHO WISH TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MISINFORMATION: UNDERSTANDING THE MISINFORMATION PROBLEM, UNDERSTANDING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DRIVERS AND PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF MISINFORMATION, FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS, AND CO-DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE POLICY MEASURES.

To test this hypothesis, we created novel deepfakes in collaboration with industry partners and a professional actor. We then experimentally assess whether deepfakes are distinctly deceptive and find that deepfakes are approximately as credible as misinformation communicated through text or audio. However, in a follow-up discernment task, subjects often confuse authentic videos for deepfakes if the video depicts an elite in their political party in a scandal. Moreover, informational interventions and accuracy primes only sometimes (and somewhat) attenuate deepfakes' effects. In sum, our results show that while deepfakes may not be uniquely deceptive, they may still erode trust in media and increase partisan polarization.",Political Deepfakes Are as Credible as Other Fake Media and (Sometimes) Real Media,media effects; deepfakes; scandals; experimental methods,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO;WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (WUSTL);EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE,UNIV CHICAGO,NA,"BARARI S, 2025, J POLIT","BARARI S, 2025, J POLIT"

THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE NEWS ARTICLES RELATED TO DEEPFAKES, FOCUSING ON THE MAJOR TOPICS DISCUSSED AND THE ATTITUDES EXPRESSED TOWARD THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. UNDERSTANDING THE PUBLIC'S AWARENESS, CONCERNS, AND REACTIONS TOWARD DEEPFAKES IS CRUCIAL IN SHAPING INFORMED RESPONSES. THIS STUDY CONDUCTED EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS, TOPIC MODELING ANALYSIS, AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BY EXAMINING 4,920 NEWS ARTICLES FROM THE NEXIS UNI DATABASE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2022. THE TOPICS DISCUSSED ENCOMPASS VARIOUS DOMAINS, INCLUDING POLITICS, BUSINESS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND MORE. WE UNCOVERED HOW DEEPFAKES CAN BE USED FOR MANIPULATION, THE RISKS THEY POSE TO INDUSTRIES, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON PUBLIC TRUST AND SOCIETY. FURTHERMORE, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF THE NEWS ARTICLES ALLOWED US TO GAUGE THE OVERALL PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF DEEPFAKES.

This paper aims to analyze news articles related to deepfakes, focusing on the major topics discussed and the attitudes expressed toward this emerging technology. Understanding the public's awareness, concerns, and reactions toward deepfakes is crucial in shaping informed responses. This study conducted exploratory data analysis, topic modeling analysis, and sentiment analysis by examining 4,920 news articles from the Nexis Uni database between 2000 and 2022. The topics discussed encompass various domains, including politics, business, entertainment, and more. We uncovered how deepfakes can be used for manipulation, the risks they pose to industries, and their potential impact on public trust and society. Furthermore, sentiment analysis of the news articles allowed us to gauge the overall public perception of deepfakes. We examined the emotional tone and attitudes conveyed in the articles to determine whether deepfakes were portrayed as a threat, a tool for mischief, or a harmless form of entertainment. This analysis provides insights into the prevailing sentiments surrounding deepfakes and their potential implications. This study addresses the research gap on the evolution of deepfake topics and sentiments over time and across diverse contexts.",Understanding Major Topics and Attitudes Toward Deepfakes: An Analysis of News Articles,Deepfakes; misinformation; news articles; topic analysis; sentiment analysis,NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,NANYANG TECHNOL UNIV,NA,"TANG Z, 2023, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC","TANG Z, 2023, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC"

Censorship, understood as the suppression of content and/or suspension of users on social media, has been used as one way to combat disinformation on the Web. This drive to sanitize digital networks carries inherent risks. In the context of 'Infodemics,' investment in user's media education should be encouraged. As methodology, the phenomenon of disinformation on the Web and the efforts to curb it were researched in both scientific literature and in Brazilian legislation. To combat disinformation, the users' education (in a sense of enabling them to filter, understand, and interpret the information that they gather) should be the main goal, as entrusting this task to third parties could bring undesirable side effects. Meanwhile, platforms, traditional media, and governments pose as 'Guardians of the Truth.' The social impacts of disinformation and of the efforts to suppress false content on the Web are discoursed in this paper through usage of MapReduce Text Mining.

Therefore, the early detection of bots is crucial. Although there have been proposed methods for detecting bots in social media, there are still substantial limitations. For instance, existing research initiatives still extract a large number of features and train traditional machine learning algorithms or use GloVe embeddings and train LSTMs. However, feature extraction is a tedious procedure demanding domain expertise. Also, language models based on transformers have been proved to be better than LSTMs. Other approaches create large graphs and train graph neural networks requiring in this way many hours for training and access to computational resources. To tackle these limitations, this is the first study employing only the user description field and images of three channels denoting the type and content of tweets posted by the users. Firstly, we create digital DNA sequences, transform them to 3d images, and apply pretrained models of the vision domain, including EfficientNet, AlexNet, VGG16, etc. Next, we propose a multimodal approach, where we use TwHIN-BERT for getting the textual representation of the user description field and employ VGG16 for acquiring the visual representation for the image modality. We propose three different fusion methods, namely concatenation, gated multimodal unit, and crossmodal attention, for fusing the different modalities and compare their performances. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis of the behavior of our best performing model. Extensive experiments conducted on the Cresci'17 and TwiBot-20 datasets demonstrate valuable advantages of our introduced approaches over state-of-the-art ones.",Multimodal Detection of Bots on X (Twitter) Using Transformers,Feature extraction; Social networking (online); Blogs; DNA; Vectors; Metadata; Transformers; Bot detection; X (Twitter); digital DNA; image classification; transformers; gated multimodal unit; crossmodal attention,NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS,NATL TECH UNIV ATHENS,NA,"ILIAS L, 2024, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC","ILIAS L, 2024, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC"

Our proposed solution focuses on leveraging facial features and transfer learning to discern fake videos from genuine ones, aiming to identify subtle manipulations in visual content. We systematically break down videos into frames, employ the Haar cascade algorithm for facial recognition, and utilize transfer learning to extract discriminative features.

WE EMPLOYED UNSUPERVISED TOPIC MODELLING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO ANALYSE MORE THAN 80,000 TWITTER TWEETS POSTED BY USERS IN AUSTRALIA OVER A SIX-MONTH PERIOD BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE SEVERE BUSHFIRES IN 2019-2020, DUBBED THE 'BLACK SUMMER'. WHILE TWEETS ABOUT BUSHFIRE UPDATES DOMINATED, POLITICS, DONATIONS AND SUPPORT, IMPACTS AND PUBLIC OPINION WERE ALSO PROMINENT THEMES. SOCIAL IMPACTS WERE IMPORTANT IN THE EARLY PHASE OF THE FIRES (SEPT & OCT 2019) WITH HEALTH IMPACTS DISCUSSED WHEN THE FIRES WERE MOST INTENSE AND ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS BECOMING IMPORTANT IN THE RECOVERY PHASE. TWITTER USERS ALSO TALKED ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSES, MAINLY EVACUATION, AS THE FIRES WERE STARTING, SHOWING THAT TWITTER PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN COMMUNICATING ADVICE TO LEAVE EARLY TO AVOID HARM. ALTHOUGH THE BUSHFIRES CAUSED DEATH, DESTRUCTION AND DISRUPTION, THE SENTIMENT OF TWEETS WAS BALANCED - 40% OF ALL TWEETS WERE POSITIVE, 36% NEGATIVE AND THE REMAINDER NEUTRAL (24%). SENTIMENTS SHIFTED LITTLE OVER TIME, BUT SOME TOPICS WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS. THE UNUSUAL SEVERITY OF THE FIRES WAS ATTRIBUTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE EARLY AND RECOVERY PHASES BUT MISINFORMATION ABOUT ARSON AS A CAUSE BRIEFLY DIVERTED ATTENTION FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE. TWITTER WAS USED TO EXPRESS ANGER ABOUT A LACK OF ACTION BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. UNEXPECTEDLY, TWITTER USERS FROM THE MOST AFFECTED AREAS WERE MORE LIKELY TO POST POSITIVE TWEETS THAN THOSE FURTHER AWAY, PARTICULAR DURING RECOVERY, SUGGESTING BOTH RESILIENCE AND GRATITUDE FOR SUPPORT PROVIDED TO THEM. ANALYSIS OF TREND DATA ON TWITTER USING MACHINE LEARNING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IDENTIFY, IN REAL TIME, WHETHER APPROPRIATE MESSAGES ARE REACHING AND BEING DISSEMINATED EFFECTIVELY, PROVIDE EARLY WARNING OF POTENTIALLY HARMFUL MISINFORMATION AND, IF UNDERTAKEN REPEATEDLY, PROVIDE A METRIC AGAINST WHICH RESPONSES TO FIRE CAN BE MEASURED.","ZANDER, KERSTIN K.;GARNETT, STEPHEN T.;OGIE,

We employed unsupervised topic modelling and sentiment analysis to analyse more than 80,000 Twitter tweets posted by users in Australia over a six-month period before, during and after the severe bushfires in 2019-2020, dubbed the 'Black Summer'. While tweets about bushfire updates dominated, politics, donations and support, impacts and public opinion were also prominent themes. Social impacts were important in the early phase of the fires (Sept & Oct 2019) with health impacts discussed when the fires were most intense and ecological impacts becoming important in the recovery phase. Twitter users also talked about emergency responses, mainly evacuation, as the fires were starting, showing that Twitter played an important role in communicating advice to leave early to avoid harm. Although the bushfires caused death, destruction and disruption, the sentiment of tweets was balanced - 40% of all tweets were positive, 36% negative and the remainder neutral (24%). Sentiments shifted little over time, but some topics were strongly associated with the expression of negative sentiments. The unusual severity of the fires was attributed to climate change in the early and recovery phases but misinformation about arson as a cause briefly diverted attention from climate change in the middle. Twitter was used to express anger about a lack of action by the Australian government to address climate change. Unexpectedly, Twitter users from the most affected areas were more likely to post positive tweets than those further away, particular during recovery, suggesting both resilience and gratitude for support provided to them. Analysis of trend data on Twitter using machine learning has the potential to identify, in real time, whether appropriate messages are reaching and being disseminated effectively, provide early warning of potentially harmful misinformation and, if undertaken repeatedly, provide a metric against which responses to fire can be measured.",Trends in bushfire related tweets during the Australian 'Black Summer' of 2019/20,Disaster communication; Risk reduction; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Topic modelling; Wildfires,CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERSITY;CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG;CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERSITY;CHARLES DARWIN UNIVERSITY,CHARLES DARWIN UNIV,NA,"ZANDER KK, 2023, FOREST ECOL MANAG","ZANDER KK, 2023, FOREST ECOL MANAG"

MANY BOTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF LOW-QUALITY CONTENT, SPREAD MISINFORMATION, AND ARTIFICIALLY BOOST THE REACH OF BRANDS AND POLITICIANS. THESE BOTS CAN ALSO DISRUPT CIVIC ACTION COORDINATION, SUCH AS BY FLOODING A HASHTAG WITH SPAM AND UNDERMINING POLITICAL MOBILIZATION. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE RECOGNIZED THESE MALICIOUS BOTS' RISKS AND IMPLEMENTED STRICT POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS TO BLOCK AUTOMATED ACCOUNTS. HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE BOT DETECTION METHODS FOR SPANISH ARE STILL IN THEIR EARLY STAGES. MANY STUDIES AND TOOLS USED FOR SPANISH ARE BASED ON ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MODELS AND LACK PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS IN SPANISH. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A METHOD FOR DETECTING BOTS IN SPANISH CALLED BOTCHECK. BOTCHECK WAS TRAINED ON A COLLECTION OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE ACCOUNTS ANNOTATED IN TWIBOT-20, A LARGE-SCALE DATASET FEATURING THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS ANNOTATED BY HUMANS IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES. WE EVALUATED BOTCHECK'S PERFORMANCE ON A LARGE SET OF LABELED ACCOUNTS AND FOUND THAT IT OUTPERFORMS OTHER COMPETITIVE METHODS, INCLUDING DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHODS. AS A CASE STUDY, WE USED BOTCHECK TO ANALYZE THE 2021 CHILEAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND DISCOVERED EVIDENCE OF BOT ACCOUNT INTERVENTION DURING THE ELECTORAL TERM. IN ADDITION, WE CONDUCTED AN EXTERNAL VALIDATION OF THE ACCOUNTS DETECTED BY BOTCHECK IN THE CASE STUDY AND FOUND OUR METHOD TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR AMONG THE BOTS THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.","MENDOZA, MARCELO;PROVIDEL, ELIANA;SANTOS, MARCELO;VALENZUELA, SEBASTIAN","BARANIUK C., 2018, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, P20;BARBIERI F, 2022, LREC 2022: THIRTEEN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION, P258;CAMINA JB, 2019, MACH VISION APPL, V30, P959, DOI 10.1007/S00138-018-0957-4;BOICHAK O., 2021, INT.

Many bots are designed to increase the visibility of low-quality content, spread misinformation, and artificially boost the reach of brands and politicians. These bots can also disrupt civic action coordination, such as by flooding a hashtag with spam and undermining political mobilization. Social media platforms have recognized these malicious bots' risks and implemented strict policies and protocols to block automated accounts. However, effective bot detection methods for Spanish are still in their early stages. Many studies and tools used for Spanish are based on English-language models and lack performance evaluations in Spanish. In response to this need, we have developed a method for detecting bots in Spanish called Botcheck. Botcheck was trained on a collection of Spanish-language accounts annotated in Twibot-20, a large-scale dataset featuring thousands of accounts annotated by humans in various languages. We evaluated Botcheck's performance on a large set of labeled accounts and found that it outperforms other competitive methods, including deep learning-based methods. As a case study, we used Botcheck to analyze the 2021 Chilean Presidential elections and discovered evidence of bot account intervention during the electoral term. In addition, we conducted an external validation of the accounts detected by Botcheck in the case study and found our method to be highly effective. We have also observed differences in behavior among the bots that are following the social media accounts of official presidential candidates.",Detection and impact estimation of social bots in the Chilean Twitter network,Social bots; Bot detection; Political campaigns,PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DE CHILE;UNIVERSIDAD DE VALPARAISO;UNIVERSITY DIEGO PORTALES;PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DE CHILE,UNIV DIEGO PORTALES,NA,"MENDOZA M, 2024, SCI REP-UK","MENDOZA M, 2024, SCI REP-UK"

We examined such moral dilemmas in a conjoint survey experiment where US respondents (N = 2, 564) indicated whether they would remove problematic social media posts on election denial, antivaccination, Holocaust denial, and climate change denial and whether they would take punitive action against the accounts. Respondents were shown key information about the user and their post as well as the consequences of the misinformation. The majority preferred quashing harmful misinformation over protecting free speech. Respondents were more reluctant to suspend accounts than to remove posts and more likely to do either if the harmful consequences of the misinformation were severe or if sharing it was a repeated offense. Features related to the account itself (the person behind the account, their partisanship, and number of followers) had little to no effect on respondents' decisions. Content moderation of harmful misinformation was a partisan issue: Across all four scenarios, Republicans were consistently less willing than Democrats or independents to remove posts or penalize the accounts that posted them.

INITIALLY, POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE INTERNET WAS POSITIVELY LINKED WITH SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, THIS HAS RECENTLY TURNED NEGATIVE, PROBABLY REFLECTING THE RISE OF DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM (AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES' USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO SURVEIL, REPRESS, AND MANIPULATE BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POPULATIONS). THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THERE ARE TWO POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR THIS: SELF-CENSORSHIP AND SOCIAL LEARNING. SELF-CENSORSHIP SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUALS CRITICAL OF THE REGIME MAY REFRAIN FROM EXPRESSING THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SOCIAL LEARNING INVOLVES ACQUIRING INFORMATION AND FORMING BELIEFS THROUGH OBSERVATION AND INTERACTION ON THESE PLATFORMS.

Initially, political engagement on social media and the internet was positively linked with support for democracy. However, this has recently turned negative, probably reflecting the rise of digital authoritarianism (authoritarian regimes' use of digital technology to surveil, repress, and manipulate both domestic and foreign populations). This paper argues that there are two potential mechanisms for this: self-censorship and social learning. Self-censorship suggests that individuals critical of the regime may refrain from expressing their political views on social media. Social learning involves acquiring information and forming beliefs through observation and interaction on these platforms. Both phenomena are influenced by digital authoritarianism in two primary ways: First, surveillance and repression by authoritarian regimes suppress political discussion, fostering conformity. Second, tactics like misinformation campaigns, use of chatbots, and artificial intelligence allow authoritarians to flood social media with propaganda, facilitating social learning of authoritarian values. This dynamic is particularly pronounced among those who already trust and support their government.",The Double-Edged Sword: Political Engagement on Social Media and Its Impact on Democracy Support in Authoritarian Regimes,authoritarianism; digital authoritarianism; digital technologies; social media; self-censorship,DEAKIN UNIVERSITY;ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY;ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE,DEAKIN UNIV,NA,"YILMAZ I, 2025, POLIT RES QUART","YILMAZ I, 2025, POLIT RES QUART"

We suggest possible options to mitigate the negative effects of online polarization in democracy, including public oversight of algorithmic decission-making, involving social science and humanities in algorithmic design, and strengthening resilience of citizenship to prevent emotional overflow. We encourage interdisciplinary research where historical analysis can guide computational methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), using Large Language Models fine-tunned consistently with political science research.

TO ADDRESS THIS, WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA META-ANALYSIS COVERING 256,337 UNIQUE CHOICES MADE BY 11,561 US-BASED PARTICIPANTS ACROSS 31 EXPERIMENTS. OUR META-ANALYSIS REVEALS THE IMPACT OF KEY DEMOGRAPHIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ON ONLINE MISINFORMATION VERACITY JUDGMENTS. WE ALSO DISENTANGLE THE ABILITY TO DISCERN BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE NEWS (DISCRIMINATION ABILITY) FROM RESPONSE BIAS, THAT IS, THE TENDENCY TO LABEL NEWS AS EITHER TRUE (TRUE-NEWS BIAS) OR FALSE (FALSE- NEWS BIAS). ACROSS ALL STUDIES, PARTICIPANTS WERE WELL ABOVE-CHANCE ACCURATE FOR BOTH TRUE (68.51%) AND FALSE (67.24%) NEWS HEADLINES. WE FIND THAT OLDER AGE, HIGHER ANALYTICAL THINKING SKILLS, AND IDENTIFYING AS A DEMOCRAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER DISCRIMINATION ABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, OLDER AGE AND HIGHER ANALYTICAL THINKING SKILLS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A FALSE-NEWS BIAS (CAUTION). IN CONTRAST, IDEOLOGICAL CONGRUENCY (ALIGNMENT OF PARTICIPANTS' IDEOLOGY WITH NEWS), MOTIVATED REFLECTION (HIGHER ANALYTICAL THINKING SKILLS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER CONGRUENCY EFFECT), AND SELF-REPORTED FAMILIARITY WITH NEWS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A TRUE-NEWS BIAS (NAIVETY). WE ALSO FIND THAT EXPERIMENTS ON MTURK SHOW HIGHER DISCRIMINATION ABILITY THAN THOSE ON LUCID.

Despite a burgeoning body of research on misinformation, it remains largely unclear who is susceptible to misinformation and why. To address this, we conducted a systematic individual participant data meta-analysis covering 256,337 unique choices made by 11,561 US-based participants across 31 experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals the impact of key demographic and psychological factors on online misinformation veracity judgments. We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from response bias, that is, the tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false- news bias). Across all studies, participants were well above-chance accurate for both true (68.51%) and false (67.24%) news headlines. We find that older age, higher analytical thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Additionally, older age and higher analytical thinking skills are associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency (alignment of participants' ideology with news), motivated reflection (higher analytical thinking skills being associated with a greater congruency effect), and self-reported familiarity with news are associated with a true-news bias (naivety). We also find that experiments on MTurk show higher discrimination ability than those on Lucid. Displaying sources alongside news headlines is associated with improved discrimination ability, with Republicans benefiting more from source display. Our results provide critical insights that can help inform the design of targeted interventions.",Susceptibility to online misinformation: A systematic meta-analysis of demographic and psychological factors,misinformation; analytical thinking; partisan bias; illusory truth effect; signal detection theory,MAX PLANCK SOCIETY;HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL,MAX PLANCK INST HUMAN DEV;HUMBOLDT UNIV,NA,"SULTAN M, 2024, P NATL ACAD SCI USA","SULTAN M, 2024, P NATL ACAD SCI USA"

TO THAT END, WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT IN 16 COUNTRIES ACROSS 6 CONTINENTS (N = 34,286; 676,605 OBSERVATIONS) TO INVESTIGATE PREDICTORS OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19, AND INTERVENTIONS TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF THIS MISINFORMATION. IN EVERY COUNTRY, PARTICIPANTS WITH A MORE ANALYTIC COGNITIVE STYLE AND STRONGER ACCURACY-RELATED MOTIVATIONS WERE BETTER AT DISCERNING TRUTH FROM FALSEHOOD; VALUING DEMOCRACY WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER TRUTH DISCERNMENT, WHEREAS ENDORSEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY OVER GOVERNMENT SUPPORT WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH TRUTH DISCERNMENT IN MOST COUNTRIES. SUBTLY PROMPTING PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT ACCURACY HAD A GENERALLY POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE VERACITY OF NEWS THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO SHARE ACROSS COUNTRIES, AS DID MINIMAL DIGITAL LITERACY TIPS. FINALLY, AGGREGATING THE RATINGS OF OUR NON-EXPERT PARTICIPANTS WAS ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE TRUE FROM FALSE HEADLINES WITH HIGH ACCURACY IN ALL COUNTRIES VIA THE 'WISDOM OF CROWDS'. THE CONSISTENT PATTERNS WE OBSERVE SUGGEST THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS UNDERLYING THE MISINFORMATION CHALLENGE ARE SIMILAR ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONAL SETTINGS, AND THAT SIMILAR SOLUTIONS MAY BE BROADLY EFFECTIVE. ACROSS 16 COUNTRIES, THIS RESEARCH FINDS CONSISTENT COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL PREDICTORS OF COVID-19 MISINFORMATION SUSCEPTIBILITY, AND SHOWS HOW ACCURACY PROMPTS AND LITERACY TIPS REDUCE MISINFORMATION SHARING AND HOW WISDOM OF CROWDS CAN IDENTIFY FALSE CLAIMS CROSS-CULTURALLY.","ARECHAR, ANTONIO A.

To that end, we conducted an experiment in 16 countries across 6 continents (N = 34,286; 676,605 observations) to investigate predictors of susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19, and interventions to combat the spread of this misinformation. In every country, participants with a more analytic cognitive style and stronger accuracy-related motivations were better at discerning truth from falsehood; valuing democracy was also associated with greater truth discernment, whereas endorsement of individual responsibility over government support was negatively associated with truth discernment in most countries. Subtly prompting people to think about accuracy had a generally positive effect on the veracity of news that people were willing to share across countries, as did minimal digital literacy tips. Finally, aggregating the ratings of our non-expert participants was able to differentiate true from false headlines with high accuracy in all countries via the 'wisdom of crowds'. The consistent patterns we observe suggest that the psychological factors underlying the misinformation challenge are similar across different regional settings, and that similar solutions may be broadly effective. Across 16 countries, this research finds consistent cognitive and social predictors of COVID-19 misinformation susceptibility, and shows how accuracy prompts and literacy tips reduce misinformation sharing and how wisdom of crowds can identify false claims cross-culturally.",Understanding and combatting misinformation across 16 countries on six continents,NA,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT);UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT);ALPHABET INC.;GOOGLE INCORPORATED;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT);RUTGERS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM;RUTGERS UNIVERSITY NEW BRUNSWICK;MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF REGINA;UNIVERSITY OF REGINA;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT);MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT),SLOAN SCH MANAGEMENT;UNIV REGINA;UNIV REGINA;INST DATA SYST AND SOC;DEPT BRAIN AND COGNIT SCI,NA,"ARECHAR AA, 2023, NAT HUM BEHAV","ARECHAR AA, 2023, NAT HUM BEHAV"

But this is not just an action-oriented change as computational systems can also introduce epistemological transformations in the constitution of concepts and ideas. However, a lack of public understanding of how algorithms work also makes them a source of distrust, especially concerning the way in which they can be used to create frames or channels for social and individual behaviour. This public concern has been magnified by election hacking, social media disinformation, data extractivism, and a sense that Silicon Valley companies are out of control. The wide adoption of algorithms into so many aspects of peoples' lives, often without public debate, has meant that increasingly algorithms are seen as mysterious and opaque, when they are not seen as inequitable or biased. Up until recently it has been difficult to challenge algorithms or to question their functioning, especially with wide acceptance that softwares inner workings were incomprehensible, proprietary or secret (cf. open source). Asking why an algorithm did what it did often was not thought particularly interesting outside of a strictly programming context. This meant that there has been a widening explanatory gap in relation to understanding algorithms and their effect on peoples' lived experiences. This paper argues that Critical Code Studies offers a novel field for developing theoretical and code-epistemological practices to reflect on the explanatory deficit in modern societies from a reliance on information technologies. The challenge of new forms of social obscurity from the implementation of technical systems is heightened by the example of machine learning systems that have emerged in the past decade. A key methodological contribution of this paper is to show how concept formation, in this case of the notion of ""toxicity"", can be traced through key categories and classifications deployed in code structures (e.g. modularity and layering software) but also how these classifications can appear more stable than they actually are by the tendency of software layers to obscure even as they reveal. How a concept such as ""toxicity"" can be constituted through code and discourse and then used unproblematically is revealing in relation to both its technical deployment but also for a possible computational sociology of knowledge. By developing a broadened notion of explainability, this paper argues that critical code studies can make important theoretical, code-epistemological and methodological contributions to digital humanities, computer science and related disciplines.","Tracing ""Toxicity"" Through Code: Towards a Method of Explainability and Interpretability in Software",NA,UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX,UNIV SUSSEX,NA,"BERRY DM, 2023, DIGIT HUMANITIES Q","BERRY DM, 2023, DIGIT HUMANITIES Q"

In this context, the existence of echo chambers is a problem of primary relevance. These clusters of like-minded individuals tend to reinforce prior beliefs, elicit animosity towards others and aggravate the spread of misinformation. We study this phenomenon on a Twitter dataset related to the 2017 French presidential elections and propose a method to tackle it with content recommendations. We use a quadratic program to find optimal recommendations that maximise the diversity of content users are exposed to, while still accounting for their preferences. Our method relies on a theoretical model that can sufficiently describe how content flows through the platform. We show that the model provides good approximations of empirical measures and demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimisation algorithm at mitigating the echo chamber effect on this dataset, even with limited budget for recommendations.",Opening up Echo Chambers via Optimal Content Recommendation,Social networks; Echo chambers; Recommendations; Elections; Optimisation,UNIVERSITY OF LONDON;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;UNIVERSITY OF LONDON;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;INRIA;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE (CNRS);SORBONNE UNIVERSITE,CTR DOCTORAL TRAINING CYBERSECUR;CTR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;LILLE NORD EUROPE RES CTR;A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"VENDEVILLE A, 2023, STUD COMPUT INTELL","VENDEVILLE A, 2023, STUD COMPUT INTELL"

This work furthers existing studies around bias and ideological propagation in LMs by exploring its intersection with the field of memetics in cultural anthropology. Specifically, two memetic hypotheses - competition among 'selfish memes' and the presence of memeplexes - were tested in LMs. We introduced the MediaNLP dataset, a benchmark for training LMs on 'sensationalist' and 'politically correct' ChatGPT-generated news media content. We fine-tuned six LMs from a GPT-2 base model, on MediaNLP thematic subsets of religion, politics, and opinions on AI, and conducted four experiments in an attempt to reject the null hypotheses. These experiments measured variation between different models and human ground truth, assessed the impact of AI-generated content exposure using epidemiological modelling, and analysed cosine distances between key words in LM embeddings. We successfully rejected Null Hypothesis I but did not reject Null Hypothesis II, implying selfish memes may propagate within LMs but not necessarily memeplexes. The potential for LMs to propagate bias, misinformation, and disinformation (intended or unintended) presents a genuine risk in their adoption, and our work is the first to apply memetic theory to highlight unexplored questions and risks in AI-generated content.",Memes in the Machine: Ideological Propagation in Large Language Models,NA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY;UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES SYDNEY,UNIV NEW SOUTH WALES,NA,"FARLOW H, 2024, INT CONF COGN INFO","FARLOW H, 2024, INT CONF COGN INFO"

Furthermore, it remains unclear if different deepfake formats can affect citizens to differing degrees. This study employs a 3 x 2 x 2 between-within-subjects experiment (N = 951) with the between-subjects factor format (audio vs. video vs. 360 degrees-video) and facticity (real vs. fake) and the within-subjects factor reveal (pre vs. post-reveal). We explore what happens after revealing to a sample of German participants that they have been deceived by a deepfake. Our findings show that credibility of media drops across all formats after revealing the stimulus was fake, whereas the control group is not affected. On the other hand, self-efficacy is impacted even for people who were exposed to authentic news media. This shows that deepfakes may have far-reaching societal implications that go beyond deception, whereas modality seems to matter little for such effects.","After Deception: How Falling for a Deepfake Affects the Way We See, Hear, and Experience Media",deepfakes; visual disinformation; MAIN model; realism heuristic; self-efficacy; credibility,UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA;UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA,UNIV VIENNA,NA,"WEIKMANN T, 2025, INT J PRESS/POLIT","WEIKMANN T, 2025, INT J PRESS/POLIT"

Using four experiments with nearly 9,000 participants, we show that manipulating algorithmic recommendations to create these conditions has limited effects on opinions. Our experiments employ a custom-built video platform with a naturalistic, YouTube-like interface presenting real YouTube videos and recommendations. We experimentally manipulate YouTube's actual recommendation algorithm to simulate filter bubbles and rabbit holes by presenting ideologically balanced and slanted choices. Our design allows us to intervene in a feedback loop that has confounded the study of algorithmic polarization-the complex interplay between supply of recommendations and user demand for content-to examine downstream effects on policy attitudes. We use over 130,000 experimentally manipulated recommendations and 31,000 platform interactions to estimate how recommendation algorithms alter users' media consumption decisions and, indirectly, their political attitudes. Our results cast doubt on widely circulating theories of algorithmic polarization by showing that even heavyhanded (although short-term) perturbations of real-world recommendations have limited causal effects on policy attitudes. Given our inability to detect consistent evidence for algorithmic effects, we argue the burden of proof for claims about algorithm-induced polarization has shifted. Our methodology, which captures and modifies the output of real-world recommendation algorithms, offers a path forward for future investigations of black-box artificial intelligence systems. Our findings reveal practical limits to effect sizes that are feasibly detectable in academic experiments.",Short-term exposure to filter-bubble recommendation systems has limited polarization effects: Naturalistic experiments on YouTube,political polarization; recommendation systems; experiment,HARVARD UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA;PRINCETON UNIVERSITY;HARVARD UNIVERSITY;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT);DUKE UNIVERSITY;WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (WUSTL);PRINCETON UNIVERSITY;PRINCETON UNIVERSITY;PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UNIV PENN;HARVARD UNIV;PRINCETON UNIV;PRINCETON UNIV;PRINCETON UNIV,NA,"LIU NJ, 2025, P NATL ACAD SCI USA","LIU NJ, 2025, P NATL ACAD SCI USA"

The complexity of vaccine production and distribution parallel to constant political negotiations on a global level created an opaque and confusing system seedbed for misinformation, which decreased the trust in public management and authorities as the vaccination discussions became embedded in both local and global politics. In this study, we contrast the anti-vaxxers and the vaccine-hesitant people's attitudes toward the local aspects of vaccination. We compare these groups' main narratives in two key vaccine-related topics - locality and authority. Based on our analysis, anti-vaxxer comments are nonpolitical or differentiate national politics from global aspects of COVID-19 vaccination. On the contrary, vaccine-hesitant discourses are highly contextual and dependent on the continuous changing of the conditions.

Such destructive potential has been significantly enhanced by the development of on-line social networks. Several theoretical and computational studies have been devoted to understanding the dynamics and to control rumor spreading. In the present work, a model of rumor-telling in opinion polarized networks was investigated through extensive computer simulations. The key mechanism is the coupling between one's opinions and their leaning to spread a given information, either by supporting or opposing its content. We report that a highly modular topology of polarized networks strongly impairs rumor spreading, but the couplings between agent's opinions and their spreading/stifling rates can either further inhibit or, conversely, foster information propagation, depending on the nature of those couplings. In particular, a controversy-seeking mechanism, in which agents are stimulated to postpone their transitions to the stiffer state upon interactions with other agents of confronting opinions, enhances the rumor spreading. Therefore such a mechanism is capable of overcoming the propagation bottlenecks imposed by loosely connected modular structures.",Controversy-seeking fuels rumor-telling activity in polarized opinion networks,Opinion polarization; Rumor propagation; Complex networks; Sociophysics,UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE VICOSA;CENTRO BRASILEIRO DE PESQUISAS FISICAS,UNIV FED VICOSA,NA,"MAIA HP, 2023, CHAOS SOLITON FRACT","MAIA HP, 2023, CHAOS SOLITON FRACT"

AS OF MID-2022, STILL AROUND 30% OF US ADULTS REMAIN UNVACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19. THE MAJORITY (81%) OF THESE UNVACCINATED ADULTS SAY THEY WILL ""DEFINITELY NOT"" BE GETTING THE COVID-19 VACCINE. UNDERSTANDING THE DETERMINANTS OF COVID-19 VACCINE UPTAKE IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING DEATH AND ILLNESS FROM THE VIRUS, AS WELL AS TO INFORM FUTURE VACCINE EFFORTS, SUCH AS THE MORE RECENT BIVALENT (OMICRON) BOOSTER. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOSOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF COVID-19 VACCINE UPTAKE. WE FOCUS ON BOTH COVID-19-SPECIFIC FACTORS, SUCH AS COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS, AS WELL AS MORE GLOBAL PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS DOGMATISM, REACTANCE, GENDER ROLES, POLITICAL BELIEFS, AND RELIGIOSITY.METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WEB-BASED SURVEY IN MID-2021 OF A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 1376 ADULTS MEASURING BOTH COVID-19-SPECIFIC BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES, AS WELL AS GLOBAL PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES. COVID-19 VACCINATION STATUS IS REPORTED AT 3 LEVELS: VACCINATED; UNVACCINATED-MAY-GET-IT; UNVACCINATED-HARD-NO. RESULTS: OUR ANALYSES FOCUSED ON THE CORRELATION OF COVID-19 VACCINATION STATUS WITH 10 PSYCHOSOCIAL ATTRIBUTES: COVID-19-SPECIFIC CONSPIRACY THEORY BELIEFS; COVID-19 VACCINE MISINFORMATION; COVID-19-RELATED RAPTURE BELIEFS; GENERAL ANTIVACCINATION BELIEFS; TRAIT REACTANCE; TRAIT DOGMATISM; BELIEF IN 2020 ELECTION FRAUD; BELIEF IN A QANON CONSPIRACY; HEALTH CARE SYSTEM DISTRUST; AND IDENTIFICATION WITH TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES. WE USED A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE TO EXAMINE MEAN DIFFERENCES ACROSS VACCINE STATUS GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE CORRELATES WHILE HOLDING CONSTANT THE EFFECTS OF AGE, GENDER, RACE, INCOME, EDUCATION, POLITICAL PARTY, AND EVANGELICALISM. ACROSS THE 10 PSYCHOSOCIAL CORRELATES, SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESPONSE SCALES WERE USED. TO ALLOW FOR COMPARISON OF EFFECTS ACROSS CORRELATES, MEASURES OF EFFECT SIZE WERE COMPUTED BY CONVERTING CORRELATES TO Z SCORES AND THEN EXAMINING ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCES IN Z SCORES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT ALL 10 PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH VACCINATION STATUS. AFTER GENERAL ANTIVACCINATION BELIEFS, COVID-19 MISINFORMATION BELIEFS AND COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS HAD THE LARGEST EFFECT ON VACCINE UPTAKE. CONCLUSIONS: THE ASSOCIATION OF THESE PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS WITH COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY VACCINE UPTAKE HAS NOT SHIFTED MUCH AMONG THE UNVACCINATED-HARD-NO GROUP SINCE VACCINES BECAME AVAILABLE. THESE FINDINGS DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE WHO REMAIN RESISTANT TO GETTING VACCINATED AND CAN GUIDE MORE EFFECTIVE TAILORED COMMUNICATIONS TO REACH THEM. HEALTH COMMUNICATION PROFESSIONALS MAY APPLY LESSONS LEARNED FROM COUNTERING RELATED BELIEFS AND PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTESAROUND ISSUES SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER FORMS OF VACCINE HESITANCY.

As of mid-2022, still around 30% of US adults remain unvaccinated against COVID-19. The majority (81%) of these unvaccinated adults say they will ""definitely not"" be getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Understanding the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake is critical to reducing death and illness from the virus, as well as to inform future vaccine efforts, such as the more recent bivalent (omicron) booster. Objective: This study aimed to expand our understanding of psychosocial determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We focus on both COVID-19-specific factors, such as COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, as well as more global personality attributes such as dogmatism, reactance, gender roles, political beliefs, and religiosity.Methods: We conducted a web-based survey in mid-2021 of a representative sample of 1376 adults measuring both COVID-19-specific beliefs and attitudes, as well as global personality attributes. COVID-19 vaccination status is reported at 3 levels: vaccinated; unvaccinated-may-get-it; unvaccinated-hard-no. Results: Our analyses focused on the correlation of COVID-19 vaccination status with 10 psychosocial attributes: COVID-19-specific conspiracy theory beliefs; COVID-19 vaccine misinformation; COVID-19-related Rapture beliefs; general antivaccination beliefs; trait reactance; trait dogmatism; belief in 2020 election fraud; belief in a QAnon conspiracy; health care system distrust; and identification with traditional gender roles. We used a multivariate analysis of covariance to examine mean differences across vaccine status groups for each of the correlates while holding constant the effects of age, gender, race, income, education, political party, and Evangelicalism. Across the 10 psychosocial correlates, several different response scales were used. To allow for comparison of effects across correlates, measures of effect size were computed by converting correlates to z scores and then examining adjusted mean differences in z scores between the groups. We found that all 10 psychosocial variables were significantly associated with vaccination status. After general antivaccination beliefs, COVID-19 misinformation beliefs and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs had the largest effect on vaccine uptake. Conclusions: The association of these psychosocial factors with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy may help explain why vaccine uptake has not shifted much among the unvaccinated-hard-no group since vaccines became available. These findings deepen our understanding of those who remain resistant to getting vaccinated and can guide more effective tailored communications to reach them. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering related beliefs and personality attributesaround issues such as climate change and other forms of vaccine hesitancy. For example, using motivational interviewing strategies that are equipped to handle resistance and provide correct information in a delicate manner that avoids reactance.",Novel Psychosocial Correlates of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Cross-Sectional Survey,COVID-19 vaccination; health communication; psychological predictors; psychology; public health; conspiracy beliefs; vaccine misinformation; religious beliefs; anti-vaccination beliefs; reactance; dogmatism; political beliefs; health care system distrust; gender roles; gender; online survey; USA; adults; death; illness; virus; psychosocial,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN;US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS;VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA);VA ANN ARBOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SYSTEM;UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN;UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,UNIV MICHIGAN,NA,"BACON E, 2023, JMIR FORM RES","BACON E, 2023, JMIR FORM RES"
